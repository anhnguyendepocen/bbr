TABLE 1
Sources of Variation in Clinical Trials
Label
Source
Description
A
Between treatments
The average difference between treatments over all randomizations (and hence over all patients).  The ‘true’ mean difference between treatments
B
Between patients
The average difference between patients.  (Averaged over both experimental and control treatments.)
C
Patient-by-
treatment interaction
The extent to which the difference between treatment differs from one patient to another.  (Equivalently, the extent to which the difference between patients being given the same treatment depends on treatment given.)
D
Within-patient error
The variability shown from treatment period to treatment period when the same patient is given the same treatment
