To link to a specific section from a web browser that has a pdf viewer plugin, put this in the text:

\usepackage{hypperef}

\clearpage
\hypertarget{foo}{}
\chapter{...}

Then reference
http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/tmp/bbr.pdf#nameddest=foo

If you put \hypertarget after \chapter the browser will not show the chapter title.
