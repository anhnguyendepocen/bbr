@article{mat17ste,
    abstract = {{Stepped wedge designs (SWDs) have received considerable attention recently, as they are potentially a useful way to assess new treatments in areas such as health services implementation. Because allocation is usually by cluster, SWDs are often viewed as a form of cluster-randomized trial. However, since the treatment within a cluster changes during the course of the study, they can also be viewed as a form of crossover design. This article explores SWDs from the perspective of crossover trials and designed experiments more generally. We show that the treatment effect estimator in a linear mixed effects model can be decomposed into a weighted mean of the estimators obtained from (1) regarding an SWD as a conventional row-column design and (2) a so-called vertical analysis, which is a row-column design with row effects omitted. This provides a precise representation of  ” horizontal” and  ” vertical” comparisons, respectively, which to date have appeared without formal description in the literature. This decomposition displays a sometimes surprising way the analysis corrects for the partial confounding between time and treatment effects. The approach also permits the quantification of the loss of efficiency caused by mis-specifying the correlation parameter in the mixed-effects model. Optimal extensions of the vertical analysis are obtained, and these are shown to be highly inefficient for values of the within-cluster dependence that are likely to be encountered in practice. Some recently described extensions to the classic SWD incorporating multiple treatments are also compared using the experimental design framework.}},

@article{lip17one,
    abstract = {{Medical studies increasingly involve a large sample of independent clusters, where the cluster sizes are also large. Our motivating example from the 2010 Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) has 8,001,068 patients and 1049 clusters, with average cluster size of 7627. Consistent parameter estimates can be obtained naively assuming independence, which are inefficient when the intra-cluster correlation (ICC) is high. Efficient generalized estimating equations (GEE) incorporate the ICC and sum all pairs of observations within a cluster when estimating the ICC. For the 2010 NIS, there are 92.6 billion pairs of observations, making summation of pairs computationally prohibitive. We propose a one-step GEE estimator that (1) matches the asymptotic efficiency of the fully iterated GEE; (2) uses a simpler formula to estimate the ICC that avoids summing over all pairs; and (3) completely avoids matrix multiplications and inversions. These three features make the proposed estimator much less computationally intensive, especially with large cluster sizes. A unique contribution of this article is that it expresses the GEE estimating equations incorporating the ICC as a simple sum of vectors and scalars.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract The aim of the author is improvement of statistical practice. The author distinguishes between enumerative studies and analytic studies. An enumerative study has for its aim an estimate of the number of units of a frame that belong to a specified class. An analytic study has for its aim a basis for action on the cause-system or the process, in order to improve product of the future. A fair price to pay for an inventory is an example of an enumerative study. Tests of varieties of wheat, insecticides, drugs, manufacturing processes, are examples of analytic studies: the choice of variety or treatment will affect the future out-turn of wheat, future patients, future product. Techniques and methods of inference that are applicable to enumerative studies lead to faulty design and faulty inference for analytic problems. It is possible, in an enumerative problem, to reduce errors of sampling to any specified level. In contrast, in an analytic problem, it is impossible to compute the risk of making a wrong decision. The author provides a number of examples, and pleads for greater care in the writing and teaching of statistical theory and inference.}},

    abstract = {{Abstract We present a procedure for computing significance levels from data sets whose missing values have been multiply imputed data. This procedure uses moment-based statistics, m ≤ 3 repeated imputations, and an F reference distribution. When m = ∞, we show first that our procedure is essentially the same as the ideal procedure in cases of practical importance and, second, that its deviations from the ideal are basically a function of the coefficient of variation of the canonical ratios of complete to observed information. For small m our procedure's performance is largely governed by this coefficient of variation and the mean of these ratios. Using simulation techniques with small m, we compare our procedure's actual and nominal large-sample significance levels and conclude that it is essentially calibrated and thus represents a definite improvement over previously available procedures. Furthermore, we compare the large-sample power of the procedure as a function of m and other factors, such as the dimensionality of the estimand and fraction of missing information, to provide guidance on the choice of the number of imputations; generally, we find the loss of power due to small m to be quite modest in cases likely to occur in practice.}},

    abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to estimation of the cumulative incidence function in the presence of competing risks. The underlying statistical model is specified via a mixture factorization of the joint distribution of the event type and the time to the event. The time to event distributions conditional on the event type are modeled using smooth semi-nonparametric densities. One strength of this approach is that it can handle arbitrary censoring and truncation while relying on mild parametric assumptions. A stepwise forward algorithm for model estimation and adaptive selection of smooth semi-nonparametric polynomial degrees is presented, implemented in the statistical software R, evaluated in a sequence of simulation studies, and applied to data from a clinical trial in cryptococcal meningitis. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed method frequently outperforms both parametric and nonparametric alternatives. They also support the use of 'ad hoc' asymptotic inference to derive confidence intervals. An extension to regression modeling is also presented, and its potential and challenges are discussed.}},

    abstract = {{In recent years, the number of studies using a cluster-randomized design has grown dramatically. In addition, the cluster-randomized crossover design has been touted as a methodological advance that can increase efficiency of cluster-randomized studies in certain situations. While the cluster-randomized crossover trial has become a popular tool, standards of design, analysis, reporting and implementation have not been established for this emergent design. We address one particular aspect of cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover trial design: estimating statistical power. We present a general framework for estimating power via simulation in cluster-randomized studies with or without one or more crossover periods. We have implemented this framework in the clusterPower software package for R, freely available online from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Our simulation framework is easy to implement and users may customize the methods used for data analysis. We give four examples of using the software in practice. The clusterPower package could play an important role in the design of future cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized crossover studies. This work is the first to establish a universal method for calculating power for both cluster-randomized and cluster-randomized clinical trials. More research is needed to develop standardized and recommended methodology for cluster-randomized crossover studies.}},

    abstract = {{Users of multiple imputation often want to know how many imputations they
need. An old answer is that 3 to 10 imputations usually suffice, but this
recommendation only addresses the efficiency of point estimates. If users also
want replicable standard errors, users often need more imputations. A popular
rule is that the required number of imputations increases linearly with the
fraction of missing information, but we show that, in fact, the number of
imputations increases quadratically with the fraction of missing information.
This quadratic relationship implies that users should add imputations until the
degrees of freedom in the standard errors exceeds some threshold (e.g., 200).
We suggest a two-step procedure in which the user conducts a pilot analysis
using a small number of imputations and then uses the results to calculate the
number of imputations that are needed for a final analysis to have the desired
degrees of freedom.}},

    abstract = {{Bayesian statistics, a currently controversial viewpoint concerning statistical inference, is based on a definition of probability as a particular measure of the opinions of ideally consistent people. Statistical inference is modification of these opinions in the light of evidence, and Bayes' theorem specifies how such modifications should be made. The tools of Bayesian statistics include the theory of specific distributions and the principle of stable estimation, which specifies when actual prior opinions may be satisfactorily approximated by a uniform distribution. A common feature of many classical significance tests is that a sharp null hypothesis is compared with a diffuse alternative hypothesis. Often evidence which, for a Bayesian statistician, strikingly supports the null hypothesis leads to rejection of that hypothesis by standard classical procedures. The likelihood principle emphasized in Bayesian statistics implies, among other things, that the rules governing when data collection stops are irrelevant to data interpretation. It is entirely appropriate to collect data until a point has been proven or disproven, or until the data collector runs out of time, money, or patience.}},

    abstract = {{Nonrandomized studies of treatments from electronic healthcare databases are critical for producing the evidence necessary to making informed treatment decisions, but often rely on comparing rates of events observed in a small number of patients. In addition, studies constructed from electronic healthcare databases, for example, administrative claims data, often adjust for many, possibly hundreds, of potential confounders. Despite the importance of maximizing efficiency when there are many confounders and few observed outcome events, there has been relatively little research on the relative performance of different propensity score methods in this context. In this paper, we compare a wide variety of propensity-based estimators of the marginal relative risk. In contrast to prior research that has focused on specific statistical methods in isolation of other analytic choices, we instead consider a method to be defined by the complete multistep process from propensity score modeling to final treatment effect estimation. Propensity score model estimation methods considered include ordinary logistic regression, Bayesian logistic regression, lasso, and boosted regression trees. Methods for utilizing the propensity score include pair matching, full matching, decile strata, fine strata, regression adjustment using one or two nonlinear splines, inverse propensity weighting, and matching weights. We evaluate methods via a 'plasmode' simulation study, which creates simulated datasets on the basis of a real cohort study of two treatments constructed from administrative claims data. Our results suggest that regression adjustment and matching weights, regardless of the propensity score model estimation method, provide lower bias and mean squared error in the context of rare binary outcomes.

Specialized statistical methods must be used to analyze survival data in the presence of competing risks. We conducted a review of randomized controlled trials with survival outcomes that were published in high-impact general medical journals. Of 40 studies that we identified, 31 (77.5\%) were potentially susceptible to competing risks. However, in the majority of these studies, the potential presence of competing risks was not accounted for in the statistical analyses that were described. Of the 31 studies potentially susceptible to competing risks, 24 (77.4\%) reported the results of a Kaplan–Meier survival analysis, while only five (16.1\%) reported using cumulative incidence functions to estimate the incidence of the outcome over time in the presence of competing risks. The former approach will tend to result in an overestimate of the incidence of the outcome over time, while the latter approach will result in unbiased estimation of the incidence of the primary outcome over time. We provide recommendations on the analysis and reporting of randomized controlled trials with survival outcomes in the presence of competing risks. {\copyright} 2017 The Authors.

Some may think that Newton's cautionary note, which was in keeping with an experimental approach espoused by Francis Bacon, is inapplicable to current experimental method since, in accord with the philosopher Karl Popper, modern-day hypotheses are framed to serve as instruments of falsification, as opposed to verification. But Popper's "critical rationalist" framework too is problematic. It has been accused of being: inconsistent on philosophical grounds; unworkable for modern "large science," such as systems biology; inconsistent with the actual goals of experimental science, which is verification and not falsification; and harmful to the process of discovery as a practical matter. A criticism of the hypothesis as a framework for experimentation is offered.

In this t -approximation, Rubin and Schenker assume there are a finite number of multiple imputations, but an infinite number of observations in the sample. We propose a further degrees-of-freedom approximation which is a function of the within and between imputation variance, the number of multiple imputations, and the number of observations in the sample. When the number of observations in the sample is small, our approximate degrees-of-freedom may be more appropriate, as seen in our simulations.}},

    abstract = {{When performing multi-component significance tests with multiply-imputed datasets, analysts can use a Wald-like test statistic and a reference F-distribution. The currently employed degrees of freedom in the denominator of this F-distribution are derived assuming an infinite sample size. For modest complete-data sample sizes, this degrees of freedom can be unrealistic; for example, it may exceed the complete-data degrees of freedom. This paper presents an alternative denominator degrees of freedom that is always less than or equal to the complete-data denominator degrees of freedom, and equals the currently employed denominator degrees of freedom for infinite sample sizes. Its advantages over the currently employed degrees of freedom are illustrated with a simulation.}},

@article{gir16sta,
    abstract = {{In stepped cluster designs the intervention is introduced into some (or all) clusters at different times and persists until the end of the study. Instances include traditional parallel cluster designs and the more recent stepped-wedge designs. We consider the precision offered by such designs under mixed-effects models with fixed time and random subject and cluster effects (including interactions with time), and explore the optimal choice of uptake times. The results apply both to cross-sectional studies where new subjects are observed at each time-point, and longitudinal studies with repeat observations on the same subjects. The efficiency of the design is expressed in terms of a 'cluster-mean correlation' which carries information about the dependency-structure of the data, and two design coefficients which reflect the pattern of uptake-times. In cross-sectional studies the cluster-mean correlation combines information about the cluster-size and the intra-cluster correlation coefficient. A formula is given for the 'design effect' in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. An algorithm for optimising the choice of uptake times is described and specific results obtained for the best balanced stepped designs. In large studies we show that the best design is a hybrid mixture of parallel and stepped-wedge components, with the proportion of stepped wedge clusters equal to the cluster-mean correlation. The impact of prior uncertainty in the cluster-mean correlation is considered by simulation. Some specific hybrid designs are proposed for consideration when the cluster-mean correlation cannot be reliably estimated, using a minimax principle to ensure acceptable performance across the whole range of unknown values. {\copyright} 2016 The Authors.

@article{ash16ina,
    abstract = {{OBJECTIVE Prospective longitudinal outcomes registries are at the center of evidence-driven health care reform. Obtaining real-world outcomes data at 12 months can be costly and challenging. In the present study, the authors analyzed whether 3-month outcome measurements sufficiently represent 12-month outcomes for patients with degenerative lumbar disease undergoing surgery. METHODS Data from 3073 patients undergoing elective spine surgery for degenerative lumbar disease were entered into a prospective multicenter registry (N(2)QOD). Baseline, 3-month, and 12-month follow-up Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores were recorded. The absolute differences between actual 12- and 3-month ODI scores was evaluated. Additionally, the authors analyzed the absolute difference between actual 12-month ODI scores and a model-predicted 12-month ODI score (the model used patients' baseline characteristics and actual 3-month scores). The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for ODI of 12.8 points and the substantial clinical benefit (SCB) for ODI of 18.8 points were used based on the previously published values. The concordance rate of achieving MCID and SCB for ODI at 3-and 12-months was computed. RESULTS The 3-month ODI scores differed from 12-month scores by an absolute difference of 11.9 ± 10.8, and predictive modeling estimations of 12-month ODI scores differed from actual 12-month scores by a mean (± SD) of 10.7 ± 9.0 points (p = 0.001). Sixty-four percent of patients (n = 1982) achieved an MCID for ODI at 3 months in comparison with 67\% of patients (n = 2088) by 12 months; 51\% (n = 1731) and 61\% (n = 1860) of patients achieved SCB for ODI at 3 months and 12 months, respectively. Almost 20\% of patients had ODI scores that varied at least 20 points (the point span of an ODI functional category) between actual 3- and 12-month values. In the aggregate analysis of achieving MCID, 77\% of patients were concordant and 23\% were discordant in achieving or not achieving MCID at 3 and 12 months. The discordance rates of achieving or not achieving MCID for ODI were in the range of 19\% to 27\% for all diagnoses and treatments (decompression with and without fusion). The positive and negative predictive value of 3-months ODI to predict 12-month ODI was 86\% and 60\% for MCID and 82\% and 67\% for SCB. CONCLUSIONS Based on their findings, the authors conclude the following: 1) Predictive methods for functional outcome based on early patient experience (i.e., baseline and/or 3-month data) should be used to help evaluate the effectiveness of procedures in patient populations, rather than serving as a proxy for long-term individual patient experience. 2) Prospective longitudinal registries need to span at least 12 months to determine the effectiveness of spine care at the individual patient and practitioner level.}},

    abstract = {{Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models is a comprehensive manual for the applied researcher who wants to perform data analysis using linear and nonlinear regression and multilevel models. The book introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the reader in how to fit these models using available software packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors\&\#8217; own applied research, with programming codes provided for each one. Topics covered include causal inference, including regression, poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided throughout.}},

@article{ass16hem,
    abstract = {{AbstractAlthough commonly encountered, patients with combined postcapillary and precapillary pulmonary hypertension (Cpc-PH) have poorly understood pulmonary vascular properties. The product of pulmonary vascular resistance and compliance, resistance-compliance (RC) time, is a measure of pulmonary vascular physiology. While RC time is lower in postcapillary PH than in precapillary PH, the RC time in Cpc-PH and the effect of pulmonary wedge pressure (PWP) on RC time are unknown. We tested the hypothesis that Cpc-PH has an RC time that resembles that in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) more than that in isolated postcapillary PH (Ipc-PH). We analyzed the hemodynamics of 282 consecutive patients with PH referred for right heart catheterization (RHC) with a fluid challenge from 2004 to 2013 (cohort A) and 4,382 patients who underwent RHC between 1998 and 2014 for validation (cohort B). Baseline RC time in Cpc-PH was higher than that in Ipc-PH and lower than that in PAH in both cohorts (P < 0.001). In cohort A, RC time decreased after fluid challenge in patients with Ipc-PH but not in those with PAH or Cpc-PH (P < 0.001). In cohort B, the inverse relationship of pulmonary vascular compliance and resistance, as well as that of RC time and PWP, in Cpc-PH was similar to that in PAH and distinct from that in Ipc-PH. Our findings demonstrate that patients with Cpc-PH have pulmonary vascular physiology that resembles that of patients with PAH more than that of Ipc-PH patients. Further study is warranted to identify determinants of vascular remodeling and assess therapeutic response in this subset of PH.}},

    abstract = {{The current costs associated with spine care are unsustainable. The productivity loss and time away from work in gainfully employed patients contributes greatly to the financial burden. Therefore, it is vital to identify the factors associated with returning to work after lumbar spine surgery. We present a predictive model of ability to return to work (RTW) after lumbar spine surgery for degenerative spine disease. Total 4694 patients undergoing elective spine surgery for degenerative lumbar disease who were employed were entered into a prospective multicenter registry (N2QOD). Baseline and 3-month postoperative patient-reported outcomes: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EQ-5D, NRS back and leg pain were recorded. The time to RTW was defined as the period between operation time and date of returning to work. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model, including an array of preoperative factors, was fitted for RTW. The model performance was measured by the c-index. Eighty-two percent of patients (n = 3855) returned to work within 3 -months postoperatively. The risk-adjusted predictors of lower likelihood of RTW were preoperatively employed but not working at the time of presentation, those occupied with manual labor, on worker's compensation, on liability insurance, baseline ODI and NRS-BP scores, female sex, African American race, history of diabetes mellitus, and higher ASA grades. The likelihood of RTW within 3 months was higher in patients with higher education level compared with those with less than high school level education. The c-index of our model performance was 0.71. We present a novel predictive model for probability of RTW after lumbar spine surgery. Spine care providers can use this model to educate patients and encourage them in shared decision making regarding the RTW outcome. This will result in better communication between patients and clinicians and improve recovery expectations, which will ultimately increase the likelihood of a positive RTW trajectory.}},

    abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to help define the indications for rotator cuff repair by identifying predictors of failure of nonoperative treatment. A prospective, multicenter, cohort study design was used. All patients with full-thickness rotator cuff tears on magnetic resonance imaging were offered participation. Baseline data from this cohort were used to examine risk factors for failing a standard rehabilitation protocol. Patients who underwent surgery were defined as failing nonoperative treatment. A Cox proportional hazards model was fit to determinethe baseline factors that predicted failure. The dependent variable was time to surgery. The independent variables were tear severity and baseline patient factors: age, activity level, body mass index, sex, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, visual analog scale score for pain, education, handedness, comorbidities, duration of symptoms, strength, employment, smoking status, and patient expectations. Of the 433 subjects in this study, 87 underwent surgery with 93\% follow-up at 1 year and 88\% follow-up at 2 years. The median age was 62 years, and 49\% were female patients. Multivariate modeling, adjusted for the covariates listed previously, identified patient expectations regarding physical therapy (P < .0001) as the strongest predictor of surgery. Higher activity level (P = .011) and not smoking (P = .023) were also significant predictors of surgery. A patient's decision to undergo surgery is influenced more by low expectations regarding the effectiveness of physical therapy than by patient symptoms or anatomic features of the rotator cuff tear. As such, patient symptoms and anatomic features of the chronic rotator cuff tear may not be the best features to use when deciding on surgical intervention.

Therefore, we assessed measures of carotid VV, intima-media thickness (CIMT), and patient risk factors in a primary prevention population. We used multivariable linear models to evaluate the relationship between baseline covariates and a measure of carotid VV (VV ratio) and CIMT among 324 diabetics and 141 nondiabetics. Median CIMT (in mm) and VV ratio among nondiabetics were 0.82 ± 0.22 and 0.80 ± 0.19, respectively, and 1.06 ± 0.19 and 1.21 ± 0.26 among diabetics (P < 0.0001). Diabetes was associated with 36\% (95\% CI: 24.3-48.0, P < 0.001) higher VV ratio whereas a unit change in BMI was associated with ≈1\% (95\% CI: 0.5-1.4, P < 0.001) change in VV ratio. A 10-year increase in age was associated with 4\% (95\% CI: 1-7, P = 0.005) higher CIMT. Each 10 mmHg increase in mean systolic blood pressure was associated with 2\% (95\% CI: 1-4, P = 0.003) higher CIMT whereas diabetes conferred 31\% (95\% CI: 19.1-42.1, P < 0.001) higher CIMT. Female sex was associated with a 9\% (95\% CI: -12.9 to -4.1, P < 0.001) lower CIMT. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, blood pressure, and CIMT were not significantly associated with VV ratio. In this cohort of patients with low CIMT, VV ratio, and CIMT were distinctly unrelated, but each independently associated with diabetes. VV ratio and CIMT relationships warrant further investigation in large-scale studies and across a spectrum of atherosclerostic states. {\copyright} 2014, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

    abstract = {{A large body of epidemiological and experimental evidence suggests that vitamin D deficiency may promote hypertension. This raises the possibility that vitamin D supplementation could be a simple intervention to reduce blood pressure, but data from prospective, randomized trials are limited. A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial was conducted at 4 sites in the United States. We enrolled 534 individuals 18 to 50 years of age with low vitamin D status (25-hydroxyvitamin D levels ≤25 ng/mL) and systolic blood pressure of 120 to 159 mm Hg. Participants were randomized to high-dose (4000 IU/d) versus low-dose (400 IU/d) oral vitamin D3 for 6 months. The primary end point was change in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure. Secondary end points included change in ambulatory diastolic blood pressure and clinic systolic and diastolic blood pressures. The median age was 38 years, and 62\% of participants were men. Forty-six percent of participants were white, and 48\% were black. The median 25-hydroxyvitamin D level at baseline was 15.3 ng/mL. Four-hundred fifty-five participants (85\%) had at least 1 follow-up blood pressure measurement; 383 participants (72\%) completed the full 6-month study. At the end of the study, there was no significant difference in the primary end point (change in mean 24-hour systolic blood pressure, -0.8 versus -1.6 mm Hg in the high-dose and low-dose arms; P=0.71) or in any of the secondary end points. Furthermore, there was no evidence of association between change in 25-hydroxyvitamin D and change in 24-hour systolic blood pressure at 6 months (Spearman correlation coefficient, -0.05, P=0.34). Results were consistent across prespecified subgroups. Vitamin D supplementation did not reduce blood pressure in individuals with prehypertension or stage I hypertension and vitamin D deficiency. Our findings suggest that the association between vitamin D status and elevated blood pressure noted in observational studies is not causal. http://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

Efforts to use effective treatments for cardiovascular disease may decrease ED STEMI presentation. We conducted a descriptive epidemiological analysis of STEMI visits to EDs from 2006 to 2011 using the Nationwide ED Sample, the largest source of US ED data, to determine the incidence of patients with STEMIs presenting to the US EDs. We included adult ED visits with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification diagnosis of STEMI and calculated incidence rates for STEMI ED visits using US census population data. Incidence calculations were stratified by age group, geographic region, and year. From 2006 to 2011, there was a mean of 258,106 STEMIs presenting to EDs per year, decreasing from 300,466 in 2006 to 227,343 in 2011. Incidence of ED STEMI visits per 10,000 adults decreased from 10.1 (95\% confidence interval [CI] 9.8 to 10.8) in 2006 to 7.3 (95\% CI 6.8 to 7.8) in 2011. The Midwest had the highest rate of ED STEMIs at 10.0 (95\% CI 9.2 to 10.8) and the West had the lowest with 6.6 (95\% CI 6.1 to 7.0). The incidence of STEMI decreased for all age groups during the study period. In conclusion, we report the first national estimates of STEMI presentation to US EDs, which demonstrate decreasing incidence across all age groups and all geographic regions from 2006 to 2011. A decreasing STEMI incidence may affect the quality and timeliness of STEMI care. Continued national STEMI surveillance is needed to guide healthcare resource allocation.

Retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected cohort of 188 consecutive patients treated with TH in the cardiovascular intensive care unit of an academic tertiary care hospital. Neurologically intact survival was observed in 73/188 (38.8\%) patients at hospital discharge and in 48/162 (29.6\%) patients at a median follow up interval of 3 months. Patients in shock at the time of admission had lower baseline MAP at the initiation of TH (81 versus 87mmHg; p=0.002), but had similar achieved MAP during TH (80.3 versus 83.7mmHg; p=0.11). Shock on admission was associated with poor survival (18\% versus 52\%; p<0.001). Vasopressor use among all patients was common (84.6\%) and was not associated with increased mortality. A multivariable analysis including age, initial rhythm, time to return of spontaneous circulation, baseline MAP and achieved MAP did not demonstrate a relationship between MAP achieved during TH and poor neurological outcome at hospital discharge (OR 1.28, 95\% CI 0.40-4.06; p=0.87) or at outpatient follow up (OR 1.09, 95\% CI 0.32-3.75; p=0.976). We did not observe a relationship between higher achieved MAP during TH and neurologically intact survival. However, shock at the time of admission was clearly associated with poor outcomes in our study population. These data do not support the use of vasopressors to artificially increase MAP in the absence of shock.

    abstract = {{Clinicians have difficulty predicting need for hospitalization of children with acute asthma exacerbations. The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate a multivariable asthma prediction rule (APR) to inform hospitalization decision making in children aged 5-17 years with acute asthma exacerbations. Between April 2008 and February 2013 we enrolled a prospective cohort of patients aged 5-17 years with asthma who presented to our pediatric emergency department with acute exacerbations. Predictors for APR modeling included 15 demographic characteristics, asthma chronic control measures, and pulmonary examination findings in participants at the time of triage and before treatment. The primary outcome variable for APR modeling was need for hospitalization (length of stay >24 h for those admitted to hospital or relapse for those discharged). A secondary outcome was the hospitalization decision of the clinical team. We used penalized maximum likelihood multiple logistic regression modeling to examine the adjusted association of each predictor variable with the outcome. Backward step-down variable selection techniques were used to yield reduced-form models. Data from 928 of 933 participants were used for prediction rule modeling, with median [interquartile range] age 8.8 [6.9, 11.2] years, 61\% male, and 59\% African-American race. Both full (penalized) and reduced-form models for each outcome calibrated well, with bootstrap-corrected c-indices of 0.74 and 0.73 for need for hospitalization and 0.81 in each case for hospitalization decision. The APR predicts the need for hospitalization of children with acute asthma exacerbations using predictor variables available at the time of presentation to an emergency department.

We aimed to derive and internally validate the first prospective, ED-based clinical decision aid to identify patients with AF at low risk for 30-day adverse events. We performed a prospective cohort study at a university-affiliated tertiary-care ED. Patients were enrolled from June 9, 2010, to February 28, 2013, and followed for 30 days. We enrolled a convenience sample of patients in ED presenting with symptomatic AF. Candidate predictors were based on ED data available in the first 2 hours. The decision aid was derived using model approximation (preconditioning) followed by strong bootstrap internal validation. We used an ordinal outcome hierarchy defined as the incidence of the most severe adverse event within 30 days of the ED evaluation. Of 497 patients enrolled, stroke and AF-related death occurred in 13 (3\%) and 4 (<1\%) patients, respectively. The decision aid included the following: age, triage vitals (systolic blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen requirement), medical history (heart failure, home sotalol use, previous percutaneous coronary intervention, electrical cardioversion, cardiac ablation, frequency of AF symptoms), and ED data (2 hours heart rate, chest radiograph results, hemoglobin, creatinine, and brain natriuretic peptide). The decision aid's c-statistic in predicting any 30-day adverse event was 0.7 (95\% confidence interval 0.65, 0.76). In conclusion, in patients with AF in the ED, Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter Outcome Risk Determination provides the first evidence-based decision aid for identifying patients who are at low risk for 30-day adverse events and candidates for safe discharge.

    abstract = {{Limited information exists regarding predictors of general quality of life following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction with up to six-year follow-up. We hypothesized that certain variables evaluated at the time of ACL reconstruction will predict the general quality of life as measured by the Short Form-36 (SF-36). All unilateral ACL reconstructions from 2002 to 2004 in patients currently enrolled in a prospective multicenter cohort were evaluated. Patients preoperatively completed the SF-36 validated outcome instrument. Surgeons documented intra-articular pathological conditions and treatment, as well as the ACL reconstruction surgical technique. At baseline and at a minimum of two and six years postoperatively, patients completed the SF-36. Longitudinal analysis was performed for the two-year and six-year end points. Of the initial 1512 subjects, at least one follow-up questionnaire was obtained from 1411 subjects (93\%). The cohort was 44\% female, and the median patient age at enrollment was twenty-three years. The mean scores were 41.9 points for the Physical Component Summary (PCS) and 51.7 points for the Mental Component Summary (MCS) at baseline, 53.6 points for the PCS and 52.0 points for the MCS at two years, and 54.0 points for the PCS and 52.4 points for the MCS at six years. Significant predictors of a higher PCS score were a higher baseline PCS score, younger age, lower baseline body mass index, having >50\% of the lateral meniscus excised, or having no treatment done on a lateral meniscal tear. In contrast, significant predictors of a lower PCS score were a shorter follow-up time since surgery, revision ACL reconstruction, smoking at baseline, fewer years of education, and chondromalacia of the lateral tibial plateau. The mean utility gained at six years after ACL reconstruction was 5.3 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Large improvements in the PCS (with an effect size of 1.2) were noted at two years and were maintained at six years after ACL reconstruction. Lower education and smoking were significant predictors of lower PCS and MCS scores. ACL reconstruction resulted in a relatively high gain of QALYs.

    abstract = {{Although opioid pain relievers are commonly prescribed in pregnancy, their association with neonatal outcomes is poorly described. Our objectives were to identify neonatal complications associated with antenatal opioid pain reliever exposure and to establish predictors of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). We used prescription and administrative data linked to vital statistics for mothers and infants enrolled in the Tennessee Medicaid program between 2009 and 2011. A random sample of NAS cases was validated by medical record review. The association of antenatal exposures with NAS was evaluated by using multivariable logistic regression, controlling for maternal and infant characteristics. Of 112,029 pregnant women, 31,354 (28\%) filled ≥ 1 opioid prescription. Women prescribed opioid pain relievers were more likely than those not prescribed opioids (P < .001) to have depression (5.3\% vs 2.7\%), anxiety disorder (4.3\% vs 1.6\%) and to smoke tobacco (41.8\% vs 25.8\%). Infants with NAS and opioid-exposed infants were more likely than unexposed infants to be born at a low birth weight (21.2\% vs 11.8\% vs 9.9\%; P < .001). In a multivariable model, higher cumulative opioid exposure for short-acting preparations (P < .001), opioid type (P < .001), number of daily cigarettes smoked (P < .001), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use (odds ratio: 2.08 [95\% confidence interval: 1.67-2.60]) were associated with greater risk of developing NAS. Prescription opioid use in pregnancy is common and strongly associated with neonatal complications. Antenatal cumulative prescription opioid exposure, opioid type, tobacco use, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use increase the risk of NAS.

    abstract = {{Accurate identification of atrial fibrillation episodes from polysomnograms is important for research purposes but requires manual review of a large number of long electrocardiographic tracings. As automated assessment of these tracings for atrial fibrillation may improve efficiency, this study aimed to evaluate this approach in polysomnogram-derived electrocardiographic data. A previously described algorithm to detect atrial fibrillation from single-lead electrocardiograms was applied to polysomnograms from a large epidemiologic study of obstructive sleep apnea in older men (Osteoporotic Fractures in Men [MrOS] Sleep Study). Atrial fibrillation status during each participant's PSG was determined by independent manual review. Models to predict atrial fibrillation status from a combination of algorithm output and clinical/polysomnographic characteristics were developed, and their accuracy was evaluated using standard statistical techniques. Derivation and validation cohorts each consisted of 1395 individuals; 5 \% of each group had atrial fibrillation. Model parameters were optimized for the derivation cohort using the Akaike information criterion. Application to the validation cohort of these optimized models revealed high sensitivity (85-90 \%) and specificity (90-95 \%) as well as good predictive ability, as assessed by the C statistic (>0.9) and generalized R (2) values (∼0.6). Addition of cardiovascular or polysomnogram data to the models did not improve their performance. In a research setting, automated detection of atrial fibrillation from polysomnogram-derived electrocardiographic signals appears feasible and agrees well with manual identification. Future studies can evaluate the utility of this technique as applied to clinical polysomnograms and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring.}},

Protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), encoded by F2R, is a high affinity thrombin receptor on platelets and the target of the antiplatelet drug vorapaxar. The intronic single nucleotide polymorphism F2R IVS-14 A/T affects PAR1 receptor density and function. We hypothesized that carriers of the T allele, who have been shown to have decreased platelet reactivity, would be at lower risk for thrombotic events, but higher risk for bleeding following PCI. Using BioVU, the Vanderbilt DNA repository linked to the electronic medical record, we studied 660 patients who underwent PCI for unstable or stable coronary artery disease. Primary outcome measures were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, composite of revascularization, MI, stroke, death) and bleeding (assessed by Bleeding Academic Research Consortium scale) over 24 months. The minor allele (T) frequency was 14.8 \%. There were no genotypic differences in the frequency of MACE (33.7, 28.8, and 31.6 \% for A/A, A/T, and T/T respectively, P = 0.50) or bleeding (15.7, 14.7, and 18.8 \% for A/A, A/T, and T/T respectively, P = 0.90). In a Cox regression model, fully adjusted for age, race, sex, BMI, and smoking status, carrying a T allele was not associated with MACE (HR 1.19, 95 \% CI 0.89-1.59, P = 0.23) or bleeding (HR 0.73, 95 \% CI 0.37-1.4, P = 0.34). In conclusion, in our population, F2R IVS-14 PAR1 variability does not affect risk of MACE or bleeding following PCI.}},

This failure in translation has led investigators to speculate that the animal models being used do not predict therapeutic responses in humans. Although this issue continues to be debated, an important concern that has not been addressed is whether improvements in preclinical study design can be identified that might also increase the likelihood of translating basic AKI research into clinical practice using the current models. In this review, we have taken an evidence-based approach to identify common weaknesses in study design and reporting in preclinical AKI research that may contribute to the poor translatability of the findings. We focused on use of N-acetylcysteine or sodium bicarbonate for the prevention of contrast-induced AKI and use of erythropoietin for the prevention of AKI, two therapeutic approaches that have been extensively studied in clinical trials. On the basis of our findings, we identified five areas for improvement in preclinical study design and reporting.

Our objective was to determine whether oral vitamin D3 influences T-cell activation in humans with vitamin D deficiency. This was a single-center ancillary study within Vitamin D Therapy in Individuals at High Risk of Hypertension, a double-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. This study was undertaken in a single academic medical center. Adults with vitamin D deficiency and untreated pre- or early stage I hypertension were included. In Vitamin D Therapy in Individuals at High Risk of Hypertension, participants were randomized to either low- (400 IU daily) or high- (4000 IU daily) dose oral vitamin D3 for 6 months. In this ancillary study of 38 patients, we measured CD4+ T-cell activation estimated by intracellular ATP release after stimulation of whole blood with plant lectin phytohemagglutinin collected at baseline (pretreatment) and 2-month follow-up. Determining whether ATP level changes were significantly different between treatment groups was the main outcome measure. Treatment with 4000 IU of vitamin D3 decreased intracellular CD4+ ATP release by 95.5 ng/ml (interquartile range, -219.5 to 105.8). In contrast, 400 IU of vitamin D3 decreased intracellular CD4+ ATP release by 0.5 ng/ml (interquartile range, -69.2 to 148.5). In a proportional odds model, high-dose vitamin D3 was more likely than low-dose vitamin D3 to decrease CD4+ ATP release (odds ratio, 3.43; 95\% confidence interval, 1.06-1.11). In this ancillary study of a randomized controlled trial, we found that high-dose vitamin D3 significantly reduced CD4+ T-cell activation compared to low-dose vitamin D3, providing human evidence that vitamin D can influence cell-mediated immunity.}},

For NO EAS patients, the driveline was permanently anchored internally to the rectus fascia. Cox proportional analysis was performed to assess the effect of EAS on time to first confirmed DLI. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups (all p = 0.3). Mean follow-up time was 0.93 years. A total of 18 (11.1\%) patients developed confirmed culture positive DLI, with "first infection" rate of 0.13 events/year. Mean time to confirmed DLI was 0.69 years.

Using the Mini-Sentinel Distributed Database from three sites, we selected three exposure-outcome scenarios with laboratory results as baseline confounders. We compared hazard ratios (HRs) or risk differences (RDs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) from models that omitted laboratory results, included only available results (complete cases), and included results after applying missing data methods (multiple imputation [MI] regression, MI predictive mean matching [PMM] indicator). Scenario 1 considered glucose among second-generation antipsychotic users and diabetes. Across sites, glucose was available for 27.7-58.9\%. Results differed between complete case and missing data models (e.g., olanzapine: HR 0.92 [CI 0.73, 1.12] vs 1.02 [0.90, 1.16]). Across-site models employing different MI approaches provided similar HR and CI; site-specific models provided differing estimates. Scenario 2 evaluated creatinine among individuals starting high versus low dose lisinopril and hyperkalemia. Creatinine availability: 44.5-79.0\%. Results differed between complete case and missing data models (e.g., HR 0.84 [CI 0.77, 0.92] vs. 0.88 [0.83, 0.94]). HR and CI were identical across MI methods. Scenario 3 examined international normalized ratio (INR) among warfarin users starting interacting versus noninteracting antimicrobials and bleeding. INR availability: 20.0-92.9\%. Results differed between ignoring INR versus including INR using missing data methods (e.g., RD 0.05 [CI -0.03, 0.13] vs 0.09 [0.00, 0.18]). Indicator and PMM methods gave similar estimates.

    abstract = {{Lack of health insurance is associated with interfacility transfer from emergency departments for several nonemergent conditions, but its association with transfers for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which requires timely definitive care for optimal outcomes, is unknown. Our objective was to determine whether insurance status is a predictor of interfacility transfer for emergency department visits with STEMI. We analyzed data from the 2006 to 2011 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample examining all emergency department visits for patients age 18 years and older with a diagnosis of STEMI and a disposition of interfacility transfer or hospitalization at the same institution. For emergency department visits with STEMI, our multivariate logistic regression model included emergency department disposition status (interfacility transfer vs hospitalization at the same institution) as the primary outcome, and insurance status (none vs any [including Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance]) as the primary exposure. We found that among 1,377,827 emergency department STEMI visits, including 249,294 (18.1\%) transfers, patients without health insurance (adjusted odds ratio 1.6, 95\% CI 1.5 to 1.7) were more likely to be transferred than those with insurance. Lack of health insurance status was also an independent risk factor for transfer compared with each subcategory of health insurance, including Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. In conclusion, among patients presenting to United States emergency departments with STEMI, lack of insurance was an independent predictor of interfacility transfer. In conclusion, because interfacility transfer is associated with longer delays to definitive STEMI therapy than treatment at the same facility, lack of health insurance may lead to important health disparities among patients with STEMI.

Because of the problem of underestimating the residual error variance the actual probability can be very different from $\alpha$. This problem becomes of practical concern when the ratio of the number of variables to the number of observations becomes greater than 0.25, and is more serious for logistic than for linear regression.}},

    abstract = {{Simple descriptive listings and inference statistics based on 2×2 tables are still the most common way of summarizing and reporting adverse events data from randomized controlled trials, although these methods do not account for differences in observation times between treatment groups. Using standard methods from survival analysis such as the Cox model or Kaplan–Meier estimates would overcome this problem but limit the analysis to the first safety-related event of each subject. As an alternative, we discuss two models for recurrent events data—the Andersen–Gill and Prentice–Williams–Peterson model—regarding their applicability to safety data from randomized controlled trials. We argue that these models can be used to estimate two different quantities: a direct treatment effect on the risk of an event (Prentice–Williams–Peterson) and a total treatment effect as sum of the direct effect and the treatment's indirect effect via the event history (Anderson–Gill). Using simulated data, we illustrate the difference between these treatment effects and analyze the performance of both models in different scenarios. Because both models are limited to the analysis of cause-specific hazards if competing risks are present, we suggest to incorporate estimates of the mean frequency of events in the analysis to additionally allow the comparison of treatment effects on absolute event probabilities. We demonstrate the application of both models and the mean frequency function to safety endpoints with an illustrative analysis of data from a randomized phase-III study.

    abstract = {{In many fields, multi-view datasets, measuring multiple distinct but interrelated sets of characteristics on the same set of subjects, together with data on certain outcomes or phenotypes, are routinely collected. The objective in such a problem is often two-fold: both to explore the association structures of multiple sets of measurements and to develop a parsimonious model for predicting the future outcomes. We study a unified canonical variate regression framework to tackle the two problems simultaneously. The proposed criterion integrates multiple canonical correlation analysis with predictive modeling, balancing between the association strength of the canonical variates and their joint predictive power on the outcomes. Moreover, the proposed criterion seeks multiple sets of canonical variates simultaneously to enable the examination of their joint effects on the outcomes, and is able to handle multivariate and non-Gaussian outcomes. An efficient algorithm based on variable splitting and Lagrangian multipliers is proposed. Simulation studies show the superior performance of the proposed approach. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in an $F\_2$ intercross mice study and an alcohol dependence study.}},

    abstract = {{A Bayesian approach to variable selection which is based on the expected Kullback–Leibler divergence between the full model and its projection onto a submodel has recently been suggested in the literature. For generalized linear models an extension of this idea is proposed by considering projections onto subspaces defined via some form of L1L1 constraint on the parameter in the full model. This leads to Bayesian model selection approaches related to the lasso. In the posterior distribution of the projection there is positive probability that some components are exactly zero and the posterior distribution on the model space induced by the projection allows exploration of model uncertainty. Use of the approach in structured variable selection problems such as ANOVA models is also considered, where it is desired to incorporate main effects in the presence of interactions. Projections related to the non-negative garotte are able to respect the hierarchical constraints. A consistency result is given concerning the posterior distribution on the model induced by the projection, showing that for some projections related to the adaptive lasso and non-negative garotte the posterior distribution concentrates on the true model asymptotically.}},

    abstract = {{The key idea of statistical hypothesis testing is to fix, and thereby control, the Type I error (false positive) rate across samples of any size. Multiple comparisons inflate the global (family-wise) Type I error rate and the traditional solution to maintaining control of the error rate is to increase the local (comparison-wise) Type II error (false negative) rates. However, in the analysis of human brain imaging data, the number of comparisons is so large that this solution breaks down: the local Type II error rate ends up being so large that scientifically meaningful analysis is precluded. Here we propose a novel solution to this problem: allow the Type I error rate to converge to zero along with the Type II error rate. It works because when the Type I error rate per comparison is very small, the accumulation (or global) Type I error rate is also small. This solution is achieved by employing the likelihood paradigm, which uses likelihood ratios to measure the strength of evidence on a voxel-by-voxel basis. In this paper, we provide theoretical and empirical justification for a likelihood approach to the analysis of human brain imaging data. In addition, we present extensive simulations that show the likelihood approach is viable, leading to "cleaner"-looking brain maps and operational superiority (lower average error rate). Finally, we include a case study on cognitive control related activation in the prefrontal cortex of the human brain. Copyright {\copyright} 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

The typical analysis uses the same method employed for the intention-to-treat analysis (e.g., standard survival analysis) applied to the subgroup meeting protocol adherence criteria. However, due to potential post-randomization selection bias, this analysis may mislead about treatment efficacy. Moreover, while there is extensive literature on methods for assessing causal treatment effects in compliers, these methods do not apply to a common class of trials where (a) the primary objective compares survival curves, (b) it is inconceivable to assign participants to be adherent and event free before adherence is measured, and (c) the exclusion restriction assumption fails to hold. HIV vaccine efficacy trials including the recent RV144 trial exemplify this class, because many primary endpoints (e.g., HIV infections) occur before adherence is measured, and nonadherent subjects who receive some of the planned immunizations may be partially protected. Therefore, we develop methods for assessing PP treatment efficacy for this problem class, considering three causal estimands of interest. Because these estimands are not identifiable from the observable data, we develop nonparametric bounds and semiparametric sensitivity analysis methods that yield estimated ignorance and uncertainty intervals. The methods are applied to RV144. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.}},

However, the genome-wide transcriptional and epigenetic dysregulations induced by BRAF (V600E) are still unclear. The investigation of this driver mutation's functional consequences is critical to the understanding of tumorigenesis and the development of therapeutic strategies. We performed an integrative analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic changes disturbed by BRAF (V600E) by comparing the gene expression and methylation profiles of 34 primary cutaneous melanoma tumors harboring BRAF (V600E) with those of 27 BRAF (WT) samples available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 711 significantly differentially expressed genes were identified as putative BRAF (V600E) target genes. Functional enrichment analyses revealed the transcription factor MITF (p < 3.6 × 10(-16)) and growth factor TGFB1 (p < 3.1 × 10(-9)) were the most significantly enriched up-regulators, with MITF being significantly up-regulated, whereas TGFB1 was significantly down-regulated in BRAF (V600E), suggesting that they may mediate tumorigenesis driven by BRAF (V600E). Further investigation using the MITF ChIP-Seq data confirmed that BRAF (V600E) led to an overall increased level of gene expression for the MITF targets. Furthermore, DNA methylation analysis revealed a global DNA methylation loss in BRAF (V600E) relative to BRAF (WT). This might be due to BRAF dysregulation of DNMT3A, which was identified as a potential target with significant down-regulation in BRAF (V600E). Finally, we demonstrated that BRAF (V600E) targets may play essential functional roles in cell growth and proliferation, measured by their effects on melanoma tumor growth using a short hairpin RNA silencing experimental dataset. Our integrative analysis identified a set of BRAF (V600E) target genes. Further analyses suggested a complex mechanism driven by mutation BRAF (V600E) on melanoma tumorigenesis that disturbs specific cancer-related genes, pathways, and methylation modifications.}},

    abstract = {{A subset of colorectal cancers was postulated to have the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), a higher propensity for CpG island DNA methylation. The validity of CIMP, its molecular basis, and its prognostic value remain highly controversial. Using MBD-isolated genome sequencing, we mapped and compared genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of normal, non-CIMP, and CIMP colon specimens. Multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that each specimen could be clearly classified as normal, non-CIMP, and CIMP, thus signifying that these three groups have distinctly different global methylation patterns. We discovered 3780 sites in various genomic contexts that were hypermethylated in both non-CIMP and CIMP colon cancers when compared with normal colon. An additional 2026 sites were found to be hypermethylated in CIMP tumors only; and importantly, 80\% of these sites were located in CpG islands. These data demonstrate on a genome-wide level that the additional hypermethylation seen in CIMP tumors occurs almost exclusively at CpG islands and support definitively that these tumors were appropriately named. When these sites were examined more closely, we found that 25\% were adjacent to sites that were also hypermethylated in non-CIMP tumors. Thus, CIMP is also characterized by more extensive methylation of sites that are already prone to be hypermethylated in colon cancer. These observations indicate that CIMP tumors have specific defects in controlling both DNA methylation seeding and spreading and serve as an important first step in delineating molecular mechanisms that control these processes.}},

More than a hundred driver mutations have been characterized that confer the advantage of cell growth. However, how driver mutations regulate the transcriptome to affect cellular functions remains largely unexplored. Differential analysis of gene expression relative to a driver mutation on patient samples could provide us with new insights in understanding driver mutation dysregulation in tumor genome and developing personalized treatment strategies. Here, we introduce the Snowball approach as a highly sensitive statistical analysis method to identify transcriptional signatures that are affected by a recurrent driver mutation. Snowball utilizes a resampling-based approach and combines a distance-based regression framework to assign a robust ranking index of genes based on their aggregated association with the presence of the mutation, and further selects the top significant genes for downstream data analyses or experiments. In our application of the Snowball approach to both synthesized and TCGA data, we demonstrated that it outperforms the standard methods and provides more accurate inferences to the functional effects and transcriptional dysregulation of driver mutations.

    abstract = {{Bioequivalence trials are commonly conducted to assess therapeutic equivalence between a generic and an innovator brand formulations. In such trials, drug concentrations are obtained repeatedly over time and are summarized using a metric such as the area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC) for each subject. The usual practice is to then conduct two one-sided tests using these areas to evaluate for average bioequivalence. A major disadvantage of this approach is the loss of information encountered when ignoring the correlation structure between repeated measurements in the computation of areas. In this article, we propose a general linear model approach that incorporates the within-subject covariance structure for making inferences on mean areas. The model-based method can be seen to arise naturally from the reparameterization of the AUC as a linear combination of outcome means. We investigate and compare the inferential properties of our proposed method with the traditional two one-sided tests approach using Monte Carlo simulation studies. We also examine the properties of the method in the event of missing data. Simulations show that the proposed approach is a cost-effective, viable alternative to the traditional method with superior inferential properties. Inferential advantages are particularly apparent in the presence of missing data. To illustrate our approach, a real working example from an asthma study is utilized.}},

Large cohort studies provide valuable resources for building risk prediction models, as the risk factors are collected at the baseline and subjects are followed over time until disease occurrence or termination of the study. However, for rare diseases the baseline risk may not be estimated reliably based on cohort data only, due to sparse events. In this paper, we propose to make use of external information to improve efficiency for estimating time-dependent absolute risk. We derive the relationship between external disease incidence rates and the baseline risk, and incorporate the external disease incidence information into estimation of absolute risks, while allowing for potential difference of disease incidence rates between cohort and external sources. The asymptotic properties, namely, uniform consistency and weak convergence, of the proposed estimators are established. Simulation results show that the proposed estimator for absolute risk is more efficient than that based on the Breslow estimator, which does not utilize external disease incidence rates. A large cohort study, the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, is used to illustrate the proposed method.}},

When the number of centers is large, traditional estimation methods that treat centers as categorical variables have many parameters and are sometimes not feasible to implement, especially with large numbers of distinct recurrent event times. We propose a new estimation method for center effects which avoids including indicator variables for centers. We then show that center effects can be consistently estimated by the center-specific ratio of observed to expected cumulative numbers of events. We also consider the case where the recurrent event sequence can be stopped permanently by a terminating event. Large sample results are developed for the proposed estimators. We assess the finite-sample properties of the proposed estimators through simulation studies. The method is then applied to national hospital admissions data for end stage renal disease patients.}},

Meta-analysis is essential to this endeavor because large sample sizes are required for detecting associations with rare variants. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of statistical methods for meta-analysis of sequencing studies for discovering rare-variant associations. Specifically, we discuss the calculation of relevant summary statistics from participating studies, the construction of gene-level association tests, the choice of transformation for quantitative traits, the use of fixed-effects versus random-effects models, and the removal of shadow association signals through conditional analysis. We also show that meta-analysis based on properly calculated summary statistics is as powerful as joint analysis of individual-participant data. In addition, we demonstrate the performance of different meta-analysis methods by using both simulated and empirical data. We then compare four major software packages for meta-analysis of rare-variant associations?MASS, RAREMETAL, MetaSKAT, and seqMeta?in terms of the underlying statistical methodology, analysis pipeline, and software interface. Finally, we present PreMeta, a software interface that integrates the four meta-analysis packages and allows a consortium to combine otherwise incompatible summary statistics.}},

    abstract = {{To many, the foundations of statistical inference are cryptic and irrelevant to routine statistical practice. The analysis of 2 x 2 contingency tables, omnipresent in the scientific literature, is a case in point. Fisher's exact test is routinely used even though it has been fraught with controversy for over 70 years. The problem, not widely acknowledged, is that several different p-values can be associated with a single table, making scientific inference inconsistent. The root cause of this controversy lies in the table's origins and the manner in which nuisance parameters are eliminated. However, fundamental statistical principles (e.g., sufficiency, ancillarity, conditionality, and likelihood) can shed light on the controversy and guide our approach in using this test. In this paper, we use these fundamental principles to show how much information is lost when the tables origins are ignored and when various approaches are used to eliminate unknown nuisance parameters. We present novel likelihood contours to aid in the visualization of information loss and show that the information loss is often virtually non-existent. We find that problems arising from the discreteness of the sample space are exacerbated by p-value-based inference. Accordingly, methods that are less sensitive to this discreteness - likelihood ratios, posterior probabilities and mid-p-values - lead to more consistent inferences.}},

The proportional hazards assumption of the Cox model, however, is frequently violated in practice and many alternative models have been proposed in the statistical literature. Unfortunately, the regression coefficients obtained from different models are often not directly comparable. To overcome this problem, we propose a family of weighted hazard ratio measures that are based on the marginal survival curves or marginal hazard functions, and can be estimated using readily available output from various modeling approaches. The proposed transformation family includes the transformations considered by Schemper et al. (Statist Med 28:2473-2489, 2009) as special cases. In addition, we propose a novel estimate of the weighted hazard ratio based on the maximum departure from the null hypothesis within the transformation family, and develop a Kolmogorov[Formula: see text]Smirnov type of test statistic based on this estimate. Simulation studies show that when the hazard functions of two groups either converge or diverge, this new estimate yields a more powerful test than tests based on the individual transformations recommended in Schemper et al. (Statist Med 28:2473-2489, 2009), with a similar magnitude of power loss when the hazards cross. The proposed estimates and test statistics are applied to a colorectal cancer clinical trial.}},

    abstract = {{Objectives
We aimed to compare modeling approaches to estimate the individual survival benefit of treatment with either coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with complex coronary artery disease.

Study Design and Setting
We estimated survival with Cox regression models that included the treatment variable (CABG/PCI) interacting with either an internally developed overall prognostic index (PI) or with individual prognostic factors. We analyzed data of patients who were randomized in the Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surg trial (1,800 patients, 178 deaths).

Results
A negligible interaction with the PI (P = 0.51) led to 4-year survival estimates in favor of CABG for all patients. In contrast, individual interactions indicated substantial relative treatment effect heterogeneity (overall interaction P = 0.004), and estimates of 4-year survival were numerically in favor of CABG for 1,275 of 1,800 patients (71\%; 519 with 95\% confidence). To test the more complex model with individual interactions, we first used penalized regression, resulting in smaller but largely consistent individual estimates of the survival difference between CABG and PCI. Second, strong treatment interactions were confirmed at external validation in 2,891 patients from a multinational registry.

Conclusion
Modeling strategies that omit interactions may result in misleading estimates of absolute treatment benefit for individual patients with the potential hazard of suboptimal decision making.}},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Multiple imputation is becoming increasingly popular for handling missing data. However, it is often implemented without adequate consideration of whether it offers any advantage over complete case analysis for the research question of interest, or whether potential gains may be offset by bias from a poorly fitting imputation model, particularly as the amount of missing data increases.METHODS:Simulated datasets (n=1000) drawn from a synthetic population were used to explore information recovery from multiple imputation in estimating the coefficient of a binary exposure variable when various proportions of data (10-90\%) were set missing at random in a highly-skewed continuous covariate or in the binary exposure. Imputation was performed using multivariate normal imputation (MVNI), with a simple or zero-skewness log transformation to manage non-normality. Bias, precision, mean-squared error and coverage for a set of regression parameter estimates were compared between multiple imputation and complete case analyses.RESULTS:For missingness in the continuous covariate, multiple imputation produced less bias and greater precision for the effect of the binary exposure variable, compared with complete case analysis, with larger gains in precision with more missing data. However, even with only moderate missingness, large bias and substantial under-coverage were apparent in estimating the continuous covariate's effect when skewness was not adequately addressed. For missingness in the binary covariate, all estimates had negligible bias but gains in precision from multiple imputation were minimal, particularly for the coefficient of the binary exposure.CONCLUSIONS:Although multiple imputation can be useful if covariates required for confounding adjustment are missing, benefits are likely to be minimal when data are missing in the exposure variable of interest. Furthermore, when there are large amounts of missingness, multiple imputation can become unreliable and introduce bias not present in a complete case analysis if the imputation model is not appropriate. Epidemiologists dealing with missing data should keep in mind the potential limitations as well as the potential benefits of multiple imputation. Further work is needed to provide clearer guidelines on effective application of this method.}},

    abstract = {{Selection and measurement of confounders is critical for successful adjustment in nonrandomized studies. Although the principles behind confounder selection are now well established, variable selection for confounder adjustment remains a difficult problem in practice, particularly in secondary analyses of databases. We present a simulation study that compares the high-dimensional propensity score algorithm for variable selection with approaches that utilize direct adjustment for all potential confounders via regularized regression, including ridge regression and lasso regression. Simulations were based on 2 previously published pharmacoepidemiologic cohorts and used the plasmode simulation framework to create realistic simulated data sets with thousands of potential confounders. Performance of methods was evaluated with respect to bias and mean squared error of the estimated effects of a binary treatment. Simulation scenarios varied the true underlying outcome model, treatment effect, prevalence of exposure and outcome, and presence of unmeasured confounding. Across scenarios, high-dimensional propensity score approaches generally performed better than regularized regression approaches. However, including the variables selected by lasso regression in a regular propensity score model also performed well and may provide a promising alternative variable selection method. {\copyright} The Author 2015.

This study sought to accomplish that goal. The nearly 1 million annual ED visits for AHF are associated with high proportions of admissions and consume significant resources. We prospectively enrolled 1,033 patients diagnosed with AHF in the ED from 4 hospitals between July 20, 2007, and February 4, 2011. We used an ordinal outcome hierarchy, defined as the incidence of the most severe adverse event within 30 days of ED evaluation (acute coronary syndrome, coronary revascularization, emergent dialysis, intubation, mechanical cardiac support, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and death). Of 1,033 patients enrolled, 126 (12\%) experienced at least one 30-day adverse event. The decision tool had a C statistic of 0.68 (95\% confidence interval: 0.63 to 0.74). Elevated troponin (p < 0.001) and renal function (p = 0.01) were significant predictors of adverse events in our multivariable model, whereas B-type natriuretic peptide (p = 0.09), tachypnea (p = 0.09), and patients undergoing dialysis (p = 0.07) trended toward significance. At risk thresholds of 1\%, 3\%, and 5\%, we found 0\%, 1.4\%, and 13.0\% patients were at low risk, with negative predictive values of 100\%, 96\%, and 93\%, respectively. The STRATIFY decision tool identifies ED patients with AHF who are at low risk for 30-day adverse events and may be candidates for safe ED discharge. After external testing, and perhaps when used as part of a shared decision-making strategy, it may significantly affect disposition strategies.

    abstract = {{We predict the onset of personal bankruptcy using least squares regression. Although well publicized, only 2,244 bankruptcies occur in our dataset of 2.9 million months of credit-card activity. We use stepwise selection to find predictors of these from a mix of payment history, debt load, demographics, and their interactions. This combination of rare responses and over 67,000 possible predictors leads to a challenging modeling question: How does one separate coincidental from useful predictors? We show that three modifications turn stepwise regression into an effective methodology for predicting bankruptcy. Our version of stepwise regression (1) organizes calculations to accommodate interactions, (2) exploits modern decision theoretic criteria to choose predictors, and (3) conservatively estimates p-values to handle sparse data and a binary response. Omitting any one of these leads to poor performance. A final step in our procedure calibrates regression predictions. With these modifications, stepwise regression predicts bankruptcy as well as, if not better than, recently developed data-mining tools. When sorted, the largest 14,000 resulting predictions hold 1,000 of the 1,800 bankruptcies hidden in a validation sample of 2.3 million observations. If the cost of missing a bankruptcy is 200 times that of a false positive, our predictions incur less than 2/3 of the costs of classification errors produced by the tree-based classifier C4.5.}},

    abstract = {{The performance of prediction models can be assessed using a variety of methods and metrics. Traditional measures for binary and survival outcomes include the Brier score to indicate overall model performance, the concordance (or c) statistic for discriminative ability (or area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve), and goodness-of-fit statistics for calibration.Several new measures have recently been proposed that can be seen as refinements of discrimination measures, including variants of the c statistic for survival, reclassification tables, net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Moreover, decision-analytic measures have been proposed, including decision curves to plot the net benefit achieved by making decisions based on model predictions.We aimed to define the role of these relatively novel approaches in the evaluation of the performance of prediction models. For illustration, we present a case study of predicting the presence of residual tumor versus benign tissue in patients with testicular cancer (n = 544 for model development, n = 273 for external validation).We suggest that reporting discrimination and calibration will always be important for a prediction model. Decision-analytic measures should be reported if the predictive model is to be used for clinical decisions. Other measures of performance may be warranted in specific applications, such as reclassification metrics to gain insight into the value of adding a novel predictor to an established model.}},

    abstract = {{The 'integrated discrimination improvement' (IDI) and the 'net reclassification index' (NRI) are statistics proposed as measures of the incremental prognostic impact that a new biomarker will have when added to an existing prediction model for a binary outcome. By design, both measures were meant to be intuitively appropriate, and the IDI and NRI formulae do look intuitively plausible. Both have become increasingly popular. We shall argue, however, that their use is not always safe. If IDI and NRI are used to measure gain in prediction performance, then poorly calibrated models may appear advantageous, and in a simulation study, even the model that actually generates the data (and hence is the best possible model) can be improved on without adding measured information. We illustrate these shortcomings in actual cancer data as well as by Monte Carlo simulations. In these examples, we contrast IDI and NRI with the area under ROC and the Brier score. Unlike IDI and NRI, these traditional measures have the characteristic that prognostic performance cannot be accidentally or deliberately inflated.

    abstract = {{We evaluated the effects of various strategies of covariate adjustment on type I error, power, and potential reduction in sample size in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with time-to-event outcomes. We used Cox models in simulated data sets with different treatment effects (hazard ratios [HRs] = 1, 1.4, and 1.7), covariate effects (HRs = 1, 2, and 5), covariate prevalences (10\% and 50\%), and censoring levels (no, low, and high). Treatment and a single covariate were dichotomous. We examined the sample size that gives the same power as an unadjusted analysis for three strategies: prespecified, significant predictive, and significant imbalance. Type I error generally was at the nominal level. The power to detect a true treatment effect was greater with adjusted than unadjusted analyses, especially with prespecified and significant-predictive strategies. Potential reductions in sample size with a covariate HR between 2 and 5 were between 15\% and 44\% (covariate prevalence 50\%) and between 4\% and 12\% (covariate prevalence 10\%). The significant-imbalance strategy yielded small reductions. The reduction was greater with stronger covariate effects, but was independent of treatment effect, sample size, and censoring level. Adjustment for one predictive baseline characteristic yields greater power to detect a true treatment effect than unadjusted analysis, without inflation of type I error and with potentially moderate reductions in sample size. Analysis of RCTs with time-to-event outcomes should adjust for predictive covariates.}},

    abstract = {{We conducted an extensive set of empirical analyses to examine the effect of the number of events per variable (EPV) on the relative performance of three different methods for assessing the predictive accuracy of a logistic regression model: apparent performance in the analysis sample, split-sample validation, and optimism correction using bootstrap methods. Using a single dataset of patients hospitalized with heart failure, we compared the estimates of discriminatory performance from these methods to those for a very large independent validation sample arising from the same population. As anticipated, the apparent performance was optimistically biased, with the degree of optimism diminishing as the number of events per variable increased. Differences between the bootstrap-corrected approach and the use of an independent validation sample were minimal once the number of events per variable was at least 20. Split-sample assessment resulted in too pessimistic and highly uncertain estimates of model performance. Apparent performance estimates had lower mean squared error compared to split-sample estimates, but the lowest mean squared error was obtained by bootstrap-corrected optimism estimates. For bias, variance, and mean squared error of the performance estimates, the penalty incurred by using split-sample validation was equivalent to reducing the sample size by a proportion equivalent to the proportion of the sample that was withheld for model validation. In conclusion, split-sample validation is inefficient and apparent performance is too optimistic for internal validation of regression-based prediction models. Modern validation methods, such as bootstrap-based optimism correction, are preferable. While these findings may be unsurprising to many statisticians, the results of the current study reinforce what should be considered good statistical practice in the development and validation of clinical prediction models.}},

@article{lar05app,
    abstract = {{The logistic regression model is frequently used in epidemiologic studies, yielding odds ratio or relative risk interpretations. Inspired by the theory of linear normal models, the logistic regression model has been extended to allow for correlated responses by introducing random effects. However, the model does not inherit the interpretational features of the normal model. In this paper, the authors argue that the existing measures are unsatisfactory (and some of them are even improper) when quantifying results from multilevel logistic regression analyses. The authors suggest a measure of heterogeneity, the median odds ratio, that quantifies cluster heterogeneity and facilitates a direct comparison between covariate effects and the magnitude of heterogeneity in terms of well-known odds ratios. Quantifying cluster-level covariates in a meaningful way is a challenge in multilevel logistic regression. For this purpose, the authors propose an odds ratio measure, the interval odds ratio, that takes these difficulties into account. The authors demonstrate the two measures by investigating heterogeneity between neighborhoods and effects of neighborhood-level covariates in two examples--public physician visits and ischemic heart disease hospitalizations--using 1999 data on 11,312 men aged 45-85 years in Malmo, Sweden.}},

@article{amb02sel,
    abstract = {{In the context of cancer diagnosis and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule on the basis of a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not external to the selection process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap external to the selection process. We recommend using 10-fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called .632+ bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules. Using two published data sets, we demonstrate that when correction is made for the selection bias, the cross-validated error is no longer zero for a subset of only a few genes.}},

    abstract = {{Diagnostics for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) are suboptimal because of limited sensitivity. We performed in vitro and in vivo studies to systematically assess the performance characteristics of an oropharyngeal pH probe. In vitro studies compared the oropharyngeal probe with a standard pH catheter in liquid and aerosolized solutions, pH 1-7. The accuracy of measurements, deviation from target pH, and time to equilibrium pH were determined. Simultaneous distal esophageal pH measurements were obtained in 11 patients with GERD. Oropharyngeal and distal esophageal reflux parameters were measured for controls (n = 20), patients with GERD (n = 17), and patients with chronic laryngitis (n = 10). In the liquid phase, at pH 4-5, the oropharyngeal probe had less deviation from the target value than the standard catheter; deviation in the vapor phase was similar (0.4 pH units). Median (interquartile) time to reach equilibrium pH was significantly (P < 0.001) faster with the oropharyngeal than the standard probe. In comparing simultaneous distal esophageal pH characteristics, 96\% of recordings with the new and standard probes were in agreement to within ± 1.0 pH unit; 71\% of recordings were in agreement within ± 0.5 pH units. Patients with chronic laryngitis had significantly higher levels of oropharyngeal acid exposure at pH <4, <5, and <6, in the upright position than patients with GERD or controls (P < .001). Oropharyngeal pH monitoring appears to be more sensitive than traditional pH monitoring in evaluation of patients with extraesophageal reflux.

In such cases researchers have often used {ad hoc} methods for trimming the sample. We develop a systematic approach to addressing lack of overlap. We characterize optimal subsamples for which the average treatment effect can be estimated most precisely. Under some conditions, the optimal selection rules depend solely on the propensity score. For a wide range of distributions, a good approximation to the optimal rule is provided by the simple rule of thumb to discard all units with estimated propensity scores outside the range [0.1,0.9].},

    abstract = {{The global burden of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has not been studied previously. Such information is important given the emergence of cardiovascular diseases in developing countries. We conducted a systematic literature review and estimated the global and regional incidence and prevalence of AAA in 21 world regions by age and sex. The search for prevalence and incidence of AAA using standard clinical and epidemiological terms was conducted using MEDLINE (1950 to 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010), AMED (1985 to 2010), CINAHL (1982 to 2010), and LILACS (2008 to 2010). Data abstracted from the systematic review served as priors for Bayesian meta-regression analyses. The analysis drew from 26 high-quality studies to estimate AAA prevalence and incidence. In 1990, the global age-specific prevalence rate per 100,000 ranged from 8.43 (95\% CI: 7.03 to 10.14) in the 40 to 44 years age group to 2,422.53 (95\% CI: 2,298.63 to 2,562.25) in the 75 to 79 years age group; the corresponding range in 2010 was 7.88 (95\% CI: 6.54 to 9.59) to 2,274.82 (95\% CI: 2,149.77 to 2,410.17). Prevalence was higher in developed versus developing nations, and the rates within each development stratum decreased between 1990 and 2010. Globally, the age-specific annual incidence rate per 100,000 in 1990 ranged from 0.89 (95\% CI: 0.66 to 1.17) in 40 to 44 years age group to 176.08 (95\% CI: 162.72 to 190.28) in the 75 to 79 years age group. In 2010, this range was 0.83 (95\% CI: 0.61 to 1.11) to 164.57 (95\% CI: 152.20 to 178.78). The highest prevalence in 1990 was in Australasia and North America high income regions: 382.65 (95\% CI: 356.27 to 410.88) and 300.59 (95\% CI: 280.93 to 321.54), respectively. Australasia had the highest prevalence in 2010, although the prevalence decreased to 310.27 (95\% CI: 289.01 to 332.94). Regional prevalence increased in Oceania, tropical Latin America, Asia Pacific high income, Southern Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Central SSA, South Asia, Western SSA, and Central Asia. AAA global prevalence and incidence rates have decreased over the last 20 years. However, rising rates in some regions highlight the need for policies to enhance global disease surveillance and prevention.}},

To demonstrate the significance of an overall clinical benefit, it is sufficient to assess the test problem formulated for the composite. However, the effect observed for the composite does not necessarily reflect the effects for the components. Therefore, it would be desirable that the sample size for clinical trials using composite endpoints provides enough power not only to detect a clinically relevant superiority for the composite but also to address the components in an adequate way. The single components of a composite endpoint assessed as time-to-first-event define competing risks. We consider multiple test problems based on the cause-specific hazards of competing events to address the problem of analyzing both a composite endpoint and its components. Thereby, we use sequentially rejective test procedures to reduce the power loss to a minimum. We show how to calculate the sample size for the given multiple test problem by using a simply applicable simulation tool in SAS. Our ideas are illustrated by two clinical study examples.}},

Recent advances in data acquisition techniques and computation power have led to considerable interest in analyzing very-high-dimensional data where the number of predictor variables and the number of observations range between 10 4 and 10 6. In this paper, we present a tool for performing large-scale regularized parametric survival analysis using a variant of the cyclic coordinate descent method. Through our experiments on two real data sets, we show that application of regularized models to high-dimensional data avoids overfitting and can provide improved predictive performance and calibration over corresponding low-dimensional models.}},

    abstract = {{The use of propensity score methods to adjust for selection bias in observational studies has become increasingly popular in public health and medical research. A substantial portion of studies using propensity score adjustment treat the propensity score as a conventional regression predictor. Through a Monte Carlo simulation study, Austin and colleagues. investigated the bias associated with treatment effect estimation when the propensity score is used as a covariate in nonlinear regression models, such as logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models. We show that the bias exists even in a linear regression model when the estimated propensity score is used and derive the explicit form of the bias. We also conduct an extensive simulation study to compare the performance of such covariate adjustment with propensity score stratification, propensity score matching, inverse probability of treatment weighted method, and nonparametric functional estimation using splines. The simulation scenarios are designed to reflect real data analysis practice. Instead of specifying a known parametric propensity score model, we generate the data by considering various degrees of overlap of the covariate distributions between treated and control groups. Propensity score matching excels when the treated group is contained within a larger control pool, while the model-based adjustment may have an edge when treated and control groups do not have too much overlap. Overall, adjusting for the propensity score through stratification or matching followed by regression or using splines, appears to be a good practical strategy.}},

    abstract = {{An emerging concern with new therapeutic agents, especially treatments for type 2 diabetes, a prevalent condition that increases an individual's risk of heart attack or stroke, is the likelihood of adverse events, especially cardiovascular events, that the new agents may cause. These concerns have led to regulatory requirements for demonstrating that a new agent increases the risk of an adverse event relative to a control by no more than, say, 30\% or 80\% with high (e.g., 97.5\%) confidence. We describe a Bayesian adaptive procedure for determining if the sample size for a development program needs to be increased and, if necessary, by how much, to provide the required assurance of limited risk. The decision is based on the predictive likelihood of a sufficiently high posterior probability that the relative risk is no more than a specified bound. Allowance can be made for between-center as well as within-center variability to accommodate large-scale developmental programs, and design alternatives (e.g., many small centers, few large centers) for obtaining additional data if needed can be explored. Binomial or Poisson likelihoods can be used, and center-level covariates can be accommodated. The predictive likelihoods are explored under various conditions to assess the statistical properties of the method.}},

However, potential misclassification might lead to detrimental effects for both consumers and payers. Although such risk has been highlighted by applied health services researchers, a systematic investigation of statistical approaches has been lacking. We assess and compare the expected accuracy of several commonly used classification methods: unadjusted hospital-level averages, shrinkage estimators under a random-effects model accommodating between-hospital variation, and two others based on posterior probabilities. Assuming that performance data follow a classic one-way random-effects model with unequal sample size per hospital, we derive accuracy formulae for these classification approaches and gain insight into how the misclassification might be affected by various factors such as reliability of the data, hospital-level sample size distribution, and cutoff values between quality tiers. The case of binary performance data is also explored using Monte Carlo simulation strategies. We apply the methods to real data and discuss the practical implications.}},

    abstract = {{Calibration, that is, whether observed outcomes agree with predicted risks, is important when evaluating risk prediction models. For dichotomous outcomes, several tools exist to assess different aspects of model calibration, such as calibration-in-the-large, logistic recalibration, and (non-)parametric calibration plots. We aim to extend these tools to prediction models for polytomous outcomes. We focus on models developed using multinomial logistic regression (MLR): outcome Y with k categories is predicted using k − 1 equations comparing each category i (i = 2, … ,k) with reference category 1 using a set of predictors, resulting in k − 1 linear predictors. We propose a multinomial logistic recalibration framework that involves an MLR fit where Y is predicted using the k − 1 linear predictors from the prediction model. A non-parametric alternative may use vector splines for the effects of the linear predictors. The parametric and non-parametric frameworks can be used to generate multinomial calibration plots. Further, the parametric framework can be used for the estimation and statistical testing of calibration intercepts and slopes. Two illustrative case studies are presented, one on the diagnosis of malignancy of ovarian tumors and one on residual mass diagnosis in testicular cancer patients treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The risk prediction models were developed on data from 2037 and 544 patients and externally validated on 1107 and 550 patients, respectively. We conclude that calibration tools can be extended to polytomous outcomes. The polytomous calibration plots are particularly informative through the visual summary of the calibration performance.}},

However, when one is interested in diseases with different disease or severity subtypes, explicitly modeling subpopulation-specific transition patterns may be appropriate. We propose a model which captures heterogeneity in the transition process through a finite mixture model formulation and provides a framework for identifying subpopulations at different risks. We apply the procedure to longitudinal bacterial vaginosis study data and demonstrate that the model fits the data well. Further, we show that under the mixture model formulation, we can make the important distinction between how covariates affect transition patterns unique to each of the subpopulations and how they affect which subgroup a participant will belong to. Practically, covariate effects on subpopulation-specific transition behavior and those on subpopulation membership can be interpreted as effects on short-term and long-term transition behavior. We further investigate models with higher-order subpopulation-specific transition dependence.}},

Statistical models can predict the absolute risk of an event such as cardiovascular death in the presence of competing risks such as death due to other causes. For personalized medicine and patient counseling, it is necessary to check that the model is calibrated in the sense that it provides reliable predictions for all subjects. There are three often encountered practical problems when the aim is to display or test if a risk prediction model is well calibrated. The first is lack of independent validation data, the second is right censoring, and the third is that when the risk scale is continuous, the estimation problem is as difficult as density estimation. To deal with these problems, we propose to estimate calibration curves for competing risks models based on jackknife pseudo-values that are combined with a nearest neighborhood smoother and a cross-validation approach to deal with all three problems.}},

@article{bak14how,
    abstract = {{An important question in the evaluation of an additional risk prediction marker is how to interpret a small increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Many researchers believe that a change in AUC is a poor metric because it increases only slightly with the addition of a marker with a large odds ratio. Because it is not possible on purely statistical grounds to choose between the odds ratio and AUC, we invoke decision analysis, which incorporates costs and benefits. For example, a timely estimate of the risk of later non-elective operative delivery can help a woman in labor decide if she wants an early elective cesarean section to avoid greater complications from possible later non-elective operative delivery. A basic risk prediction model for later non-elective operative delivery involves only antepartum markers. Because adding intrapartum markers to this risk prediction model increases AUC by 0.02, we questioned whether this small improvement is worthwhile. A key decision-analytic quantity is the risk threshold, here the risk of later non-elective operative delivery at which a patient would be indifferent between an early elective cesarean section and usual care. For a range of risk thresholds, we found that an increase in the net benefit of risk prediction requires collecting intrapartum marker data on 68 to 124 women for every correct prediction of later non-elective operative delivery. Because data collection is non-invasive, this test tradeoff of 68 to 124 is clinically acceptable, indicating the value of adding intrapartum markers to the risk prediction model.}},

    abstract = {{Ordinal responses are very common in longitudinal data collected from substance abuse research or other behavioral research. This study develops a new statistical model with free SAS macros that can be applied to characterize time-varying effects on ordinal responses. Our simulation study shows that the ordinal-scale time-varying effects model has very low estimation bias and sometimes offers considerably better performance when fitting data with ordinal responses than a model that treats the response as continuous. Contrary to a common assumption that an ordinal scale with several levels can be treated as continuous, our results indicate that it is not so much the number of levels on the ordinal scale but rather the skewness of the distribution that makes a difference on relative performance of linear versus ordinal models. We use longitudinal data from a well-known study on youth at high risk for substance abuse as a motivating example to demonstrate that the proposed model can characterize the time-varying effect of negative peer influences on alcohol use in a way that is more consistent with the developmental theory and existing literature, in comparison with the linear time-varying effect model.}},

This is carried out by emphasizing on the role of baseline responses on the estimation process. Transition models are allowed for two cases of exogenous and endogenous baseline responses. We illustrate these concepts in the special case of transition linear mixed models with centered time-varying covariates. Results of our simulation studies show that the omission, or the inclusion, of time-invariant covariates is not important in models with exogenous baseline responses, while it has an essential effect on fitting models with the endogenous baseline responses.

The optimal clinical and statistical situation for the design of such a trial is one that starts with the selection of a single primary efficacy endpoint that completely characterizes the disease under study, admits the most efficient clinical and statistical evaluation of treatment effect, and provides clear and broad interpretation of drug effect. For diseases with multidimensional presentations, however, the selection of such an endpoint may not be possible, and so drug effectiveness is often characterized by the use of composite or multiple efficacy endpoint(s). The use of a composite endpoint with components that are only slightly correlated but not quite dissimilar in their recognized clinical relevance could lead to a more sensitive statistical test and thus, adequately powered trials with smaller sample size. This note discusses the utility of composite endpoints in clinical trials and some of the common approaches for dealing with multiplicity arising from their use.}},

@article{sjo13ign,
    abstract = {{In observational studies of the effect of an exposure on an outcome, the exposure–outcome association is usually confounded by other causes of the outcome (potential confounders). One common method to increase efficiency is to match the study on potential confounders. Matched case-control studies are relatively common and well covered by the literature. Matched cohort studies are less common but do sometimes occur. It is often argued that it is valid to ignore the matching variables, in the analysis of matched cohort data. In this paper, we provide analyses delineating the scope and limits of this argument. We discuss why the argument does not carry over to effect estimation in matched case-control studies, although it does carry over to null-hypothesis testing. We also show how the argument does not extend to matched cohort studies when one adjusts for additional confounders in the analysis. Ignoring the matching variables can sometimes reduce variance, even though this is not guaranteed. We investigate the trade-off between bias and variance in deciding whether adjustment for matching factors is advisable.}},

@article{gal14ant,
    abstract = {{Neuregulin-1β (NRG-1β) is a growth factor critical for cardiac development and repair with therapeutic potential for heart failure. We previously showed that the glial growth factor 2 (GGF2) isoform of NRG-1β improves cardiac function in rodents after myocardial infarction (MI), but its efficacy in a large animal model of cardiac injury has not been examined. We therefore sought to examine the effects of GGF2 on ventricular remodeling, cardiac function, and global transcription in post-MI swine, as well as potential mechanisms for anti-remodeling effects. MI was induced in anesthetized swine (n=23) by intracoronary balloon occlusion. At 1 week post-MI, survivors (n=13) received GGF2 treatment (intravenous, biweekly for 4 weeks; n=8) or were untreated (n=5). At 5 weeks post-MI, fractional shortening was higher (32.8\% versus 25.3\%, P=0.019), and left ventricular (LV) end-diastolic dimension lower (4.5 versus 5.3 cm, P=0.003) in GGF2-treated animals. Treatment altered expression of 528 genes, as measured by microarrays, including collagens, basal lamina components, and matricellular proteins. GGF2-treated pigs exhibited improvements in LV cardiomyocyte mitochondria and intercalated disk structures and showed less fibrosis, altered matrix structure, and fewer myofibroblasts (myoFbs), based on trichrome staining, electron microscopy, and immunostaining. In vitro experiments with isolated murine and rat cardiac fibroblasts demonstrate that NRG-1β reduces myoFbs, and suppresses TGFβ-induced phospho-SMAD3 as well as αSMA expression. These results suggest that GGF2/NRG-1β prevents adverse remodeling after injury in part via anti-fibrotic effects in the heart. {\copyright} 2014 The Authors.

They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables.The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions.Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.}},

This article uses hypothetical scenarios to illustrate how the three paradoxes are different manifestations of one phenomenon – the reversal paradox – depending on whether the outcome and explanatory variables are categorical, continuous or a combination of both; this renders the issues and remedies for any one to be similar for all three. Although the three statistical paradoxes occur in different types of variables, they share the same characteristic: the association between two variables can be reversed, diminished, or enhanced when another variable is statistically controlled for. Understanding the concepts and theory behind these paradoxes provides insights into some controversial or contradictory research findings. These paradoxes show that prior knowledge and underlying causal theory play an important role in the statistical modelling of epidemiological data, where incorrect use of statistical models might produce consistent, replicable, yet erroneous results.}},

    abstract = {{Decision-analytic measures to assess clinical utility of prediction models and diagnostic tests incorporate the relative clinical consequences of true and false positives without the need for external information such as monetary costs. Net Benefit is a commonly used metric that weights the relative consequences in terms of the risk threshold at which a patient would opt for treatment. Theoretical results demonstrate that clinical utility is affected by a model';s calibration, the extent to which estimated risks correspond to observed event rates. We analyzed the effects of different types of miscalibration on Net Benefit and investigated whether and under what circumstances miscalibration can make a model clinically harmful. Clinical harm is defined as a lower Net Benefit compared with classifying all patients as positive or negative by default. We used simulated data to investigate the effect of overestimation, underestimation, overfitting (estimated risks too extreme), and underfitting (estimated risks too close to baseline risk) on Net Benefit for different choices of the risk threshold. In accordance with theory, we observed that miscalibration always reduced Net Benefit. Harm was sometimes observed when models underestimated risk at a threshold below the event rate (as in underestimation and overfitting) or overestimated risk at a threshold above event rate (as in overestimation and overfitting). Underfitting never resulted in a harmful model. The impact of miscalibration decreased with increasing discrimination. Net Benefit was less sensitive to miscalibration for risk thresholds close to the event rate than for other thresholds. We illustrate these findings with examples from the literature and with a case study on testicular cancer diagnosis. Our findings strengthen the importance of obtaining calibrated risk models. {\copyright} The Author(s) 2014.}},

Moreover, we study doubly robust FE regression to avoid outcome model extrapolation.

    abstract = {{The detection of fraud and other systematic data irregularities in clinical trials is an important issue. While awareness of the problem is growing and willingness to combat it is clear, there still appears to be a lack of detection procedures suitable for routine implementation by trial coordinators. The shortage is particularly acute for discrete data, since the majority of methods which are available have been developed for continuous responses. In this paper, we examine the suitability of existing methods for discrete outcomes and propose a new technique for questionnaire data in both an informal graphical mode and as a randomization test. This method exploits the underlying correlation structure of a questionnaire and the difficulty in fabricating such details. A data set concerning a trial of a novel drug for treatment of schizophrenia, in which the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale was used to assess patient mental health, is used for illustration.}},

The relationship between time and probability of an event can then be estimated with a parametric or semi-parametric model. The number of events observed in each bin is described using a Poisson distribution with the log mean specified using a flexible penalized B-splines model with a large number of equidistant knots. Regression on pertinent covariates can easily be performed using the same log-linear model, leading to the classical proportional hazard model. We propose to extend that model by allowing the regression coefficients to vary in a smooth way with time. Penalized B-splines models will be proposed for each of these coefficients. We show how the regression parameters and the penalty weights can be estimated efficiently using Bayesian inference tools based on the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm.

We combined two data sets containing children presenting with fever without source ( n  = 376 + 179 = 555; 120 bacterial infections). Random samples were drawn from this combined data set for the development ( n  = 376) and validation ( n  = 179) of logistic regression models. The models included statistically significant predictors for infection selected from a set of 57 candidate predictors. Model development, including the selection of predictors, and validation were repeated in a bootstrapping procedure. The resulting expected optimism estimate in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area was compared with the observed optimism according to independent validation samples. The average apparent ROC area was 0.74, which was expected (based on bootstrapping) to decrease by 0.07 to 0.67, whereas the observed decrease in the validation samples was 0.09 to 0.65. Omitting the selection of predictors from the bootstrap procedure led to a severe underestimation of the optimism (decrease 0.006). The standard error of the observed ROC area in the independent validation samples was large (0.05). We recommend bootstrapping for internal validation because it gives reasonably valid estimates of the expected optimism in predictive performance provided that any selection of predictors is taken into account. For external validation, substantial sample sizes should be used for sufficient power to detect clinically important changes in performance as compared with the internally validated estimate.}},

To date, the methods have been too complicated for non-statisticians to use. In this paper we argue that the World-Wide Web provides the perfect environment to put the Bayesian paradigm into practice: the likelihood function of the data is parsimoniously represented on the server side, the reader uses the client to represent her prior belief, and a downloaded program (a Java applet) performs the combination. In our approach, a different applet can be used for each likelihood function, prior belief can be assessed graphically, and calculation results can be reported in a variety of ways. We present a prototype implementation, BayesApplet, for two-arm clinical trials with normally-distributed outcomes, a prominent model for clinical trials. The primary implication of this work is that publishing medical research results on the Web can take a form beyond or different from that currently used on paper, and can have a profound impact on the publication and use of research results.}},

    abstract = {{Although resistance to the P2Y12 antagonist clopidogrel is linked to altered drug metabolism, some studies suggest that these pharmacokinetic abnormalities only partially account for drug resistance. To circumvent pharmacokinetic complications and target P2Y12 receptor function we applied the direct P2Y12 antagonist 2-methylthio-AMP (2-methylthioadenosine 5'-monophosphate triethylammonium salt) to purified platelets ex vivo. Platelets were purified from healthy and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients and stimulated with thrombin or the selective protease-activated receptor agonists, protease-activated receptor 1-activating peptide (PAR1-AP), or PAR4-AP. Platelet activation as measured by αIIbβ3 activation, and P-selectin expression was monitored in 141 subjects. Our results demonstrate that, compared with healthy subjects, platelets from diabetic patients are resistant to inhibition by 2-methylthio-AMP, demonstrating P2Y12 pharmacodynamic defects among diabetic patients. Inhibition of thrombin-mediated αIIbβ3 activation by 2-methylthio-AMP was lower in diabetic platelets versus healthy platelets. Subgroup analysis revealed a racial difference in the resistance to 2-methylthio-AMP. We found no resistance in platelets from diabetic African Americans; they were inhibited by 2-methylthio-AMP equally as well as platelets from healthy African Americans. In contrast, platelets from Caucasian patients with diabetes were resistant to P2Y12 antagonism compared with healthy Caucasians. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that other variables, such as obesity, age, or gender, could not account for the differential resistance to 2-methylthio-AMP among races. These results suggest that in addition to altered drug metabolism, P2Y12 receptor function itself is altered in the Caucasian diabetic population. The racial difference in platelet function in T2DM is a novel finding, which may lead to differences in treatment as well as new targets for antiplatelet therapy.}},

    abstract = {{Propensity scores are widely adopted in observational research because they enable adjustment for high-dimensional confounders without requiring models for their association with the outcome of interest. The results of statistical analyses based on stratification, matching or inverse weighting by the propensity score are therefore less susceptible to model extrapolation than those based solely on outcome regression models. This is attractive because extrapolation in outcome regression models may be alarming, yet difficult to diagnose, when the exposed and unexposed individuals have very different covariate distributions. Standard regression adjustment for the propensity score forms an alternative to the aforementioned propensity score methods, but the benefits of this are less clear because it still involves modelling the outcome in addition to the propensity score. In this article, we develop novel insights into the properties of this adjustment method. We demonstrate that standard tests of the null hypothesis of no exposure effect (based on robust variance estimators), as well as particular standardised effects obtained from such adjusted regression models, are robust against misspecification of the outcome model when a propensity score model is correctly specified; they are thus not vulnerable to the aforementioned problem of extrapolation. We moreover propose efficient estimators for these standardised effects, which retain a useful causal interpretation even when the propensity score model is misspecified, provided the outcome regression model is correctly specified.}},

I share your concerns and also tend to favour regression adjustment for the propensity score for the following additional reasons:
- it adjusts for residual confounding due to imperfect matching;
- it makes more efficient use of the information in the data;
- adjustment for both the propensity score and covariates can result in estimators with a double robustness property: they are valid if either the propensity score is correct or the covariates in the outcome model are correctly modelled.
- matching is often preferred for simplicity, but I tend to believe that regression adjustment for the propensity score is much simpler because one loses the simplicity of matching whenever one wishes to adjust for residual confounding due to imperfect matching or wishes to obtain valid standard errors.

Note that, like matching methods, regression adjustment for the propensity score also prevents the dangers of model extrapolation in settings where the treated and untreated are very different in their observed covariate data, in the sense that
- subjects with covariate values at which there are nearly only treated or non-treated individuals are down-weighted, as they contribute little or no information about treatment effect;
- valid estimators of treatment effect can be obtained when the propensity score model is correct, even when the association between outcome and propensity score is misspecified. This follows from the aforementioned double robustness property.

    abstract = {{Predicting the probability of the occurrence of a binary outcome or condition is important in biomedical research. While assessing discrimination is an essential issue in developing and validating binary prediction models, less attention has been paid to methods for assessing model calibration. Calibration refers to the degree of agreement between observed and predicted probabilities and is often assessed by testing for lack-of-fit. The objective of our study was to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess the calibration of logistic regression models. We examined lack of internal calibration, which was related to misspecification of the logistic regression model, and external calibration, which was related to an overfit model or to shrinkage of the linear predictor. We conducted an extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations with a locally weighted least squares regression smoother (i.e., the loess algorithm) to examine the ability of graphical methods to assess model calibration. We found that loess-based methods were able to provide evidence of moderate departures from linearity and indicate omission of a moderately strong interaction. Misspecification of the link function was harder to detect. Visual patterns were clearer with higher sample sizes, higher incidence of the outcome, or higher discrimination. Loess-based methods were also able to identify the lack of calibration in external validation samples when an overfit regression model had been used. In conclusion, loess-based smoothing methods are adequate tools to graphically assess calibration and merit wider application.}},

    abstract = {{Clinical prediction models provide risk estimates for the presence of disease (diagnosis) or an event in the future course of disease (prognosis) for individual patients. Although publications that present and evaluate such models are becoming more frequent, the methodology is often suboptimal. We propose that seven steps should be considered in developing prediction models: (i) consideration of the research question and initial data inspection; (ii) coding of predictors; (iii) model specification; (iv) model estimation; (v) evaluation of model performance; (vi) internal validation; and (vii) model presentation. The validity of a prediction model is ideally assessed in fully independent data, where we propose four key measures to evaluate model performance: calibration-in-the-large, or the model intercept (A); calibration slope (B); discrimination, with a concordance statistic (C); and clinical usefulness, with decision-curve analysis (D). As an application, we develop and validate prediction models for 30-day mortality in patients with an acute myocardial infarction. This illustrates the usefulness of the proposed framework to strengthen the methodological rigour and quality for prediction models in cardiovascular research.

    abstract = {{Prognostic models are designed to predict a clinical outcome in individuals or groups of individuals with a particular disease or condition. To avoid bias many researchers advocate the use of full models developed by prespecifying predictors. Variable selection is not employed and the resulting models may be large and complicated. In practice more parsimonious models that retain most of the prognostic information may be preferred. We investigate the effect on various performance measures, including mean square error and prognostic classification, of three methods for estimating full models (including penalized estimation and Tibshirani's lasso) and consider two methods (backwards elimination and a new proposal called stepdown) for simplifying full models. Simulation studies based on two medical data sets suggest that simplified models can be found that perform nearly as well as, or sometimes even better than, full models. Optimizing the Akaike information criterion appears to be appropriate for choosing the degree of simplification.}},

Absolute mortality rates for females with elevated hemoglobin A1c are generally lower than rates for males, although mortality relative to the gender-specific reference group with hemoglobin A1c of 5{\%} to 5.9{\%} is generally the same for both.\\ The importance of even small elevations of hemoglobin A1c above 5.9{\%} is apparent.

    abstract = {Fasting glucose is the standard measure used to diagnose diabetes in the United States. Recently, glycated hemoglobin was also recommended for this purpose. We compared the prognostic value of glycated hemoglobin and fasting glucose for identifying adults at risk for diabetes or cardiovascular disease. We measured glycated hemoglobin in whole-blood samples from 11,092 black or white adults who did not have a history of diabetes or cardiovascular disease and who attended the second visit (occurring in the 1990-1992 period) of the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. The glycated hemoglobin value at baseline was associated with newly diagnosed diabetes and cardiovascular outcomes. For glycated hemoglobin values of less than 5.0{\%}, 5.0 to less than 5.5{\%}, 5.5 to less than 6.0{\%}, 6.0 to less than 6.5{\%}, and 6.5{\%} or greater, the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (with 95{\%} confidence intervals) for diagnosed diabetes were 0.52 (0.40 to 0.69), 1.00 (reference), 1.86 (1.67 to 2.08), 4.48 (3.92 to 5.13), and 16.47 (14.22 to 19.08), respectively. For coronary heart disease, the hazard ratios were 0.96 (0.74 to 1.24), 1.00 (reference), 1.23 (1.07 to 1.41), 1.78 (1.48 to 2.15), and 1.95 (1.53 to 2.48), respectively. The hazard ratios for stroke were similar. In contrast, glycated hemoglobin and death from any cause were found to have a J-shaped association curve. All these associations remained significant after adjustment for the baseline fasting glucose level. The association between the fasting glucose levels and the risk of cardiovascular disease or death from any cause was not significant in models with adjustment for all covariates as well as glycated hemoglobin. For coronary heart disease, measures of risk discrimination showed significant improvement when glycated hemoglobin was added to models including fasting glucose. In this community-based population of nondiabetic adults, glycated hemoglobin was similarly associated with a risk of diabetes and more strongly associated with risks of cardiovascular disease and death from any cause as compared with fasting glucose. These data add to the evidence supporting the use of glycated hemoglobin as a diagnostic test for diabetes.},

    abstract = {Clinicians are sometimes advised to make decisions using thresholds in measured variables, derived from prognostic studies. We studied why there are conflicting apparently-optimal prognostic thresholds, for example in exercise peak oxygen uptake (pVO2), ejection fraction (EF), and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) in heart failure (HF). Studies testing pVO2, EF or BNP prognostic thresholds in heart failure, published between 1990 and 2010, listed on Pubmed. First, we examined studies testing pVO2, EF or BNP prognostic thresholds. Second, we created repeated simulations of 1500 patients to identify whether an apparently-optimal prognostic threshold indicates step change in risk. 33 studies (8946 patients) tested a pVO2 threshold. 18 found it prognostically significant: the actual reported threshold ranged widely (10-18 ml/kg/min) but was overwhelmingly controlled by the individual study population's mean pVO2 ($r = 0.86, p<0.00001$). In contrast, the 15 negative publications were testing thresholds 199{\%} further from their means (p = 0.0001). Likewise, of 35 EF studies (10220 patients), the thresholds in the 22 positive reports were strongly determined by study means ($r = 0.90, p<0.0001$). Similarly, in the 19 positives of 20 BNP studies (9725 patients): $r = 0.86 (p<0.0001)$. Second, survival simulations always discovered a "most significant" threshold, even when there was definitely no step change in mortality. With linear increase in risk, the apparently-optimal threshold was always near the sample mean ($r = 0.99, p<0.001$). This study cannot report the best threshold for any of these variables; instead it explains how common clinical research procedures routinely produce false thresholds. First, shifting (and/or disappearance) of an apparently-optimal prognostic threshold is strongly determined by studies' average pVO2, EF or BNP. Second, apparently-optimal thresholds always appear, even with no step in prognosis. Emphatic therapeutic guidance based on thresholds from observational studies may be ill-founded. We should not assume that optimal thresholds, or any thresholds, exist.},

@article{jia13int,
    abstract = {{Conventional analysis using quantile regression typically focuses on fitting the regression model at different quantiles separately. However, in situations where the quantile coefficients share some common feature, joint modeling of multiple quantiles to accommodate the commonality often leads to more efficient estimation. One example of common features is that a predictor may have a constant effect over one region of quantile levels but varying effects in other regions. To automatically perform estimation and detection of the interquantile commonality, we develop two penalization methods. When the quantile slope coefficients indeed do not change across quantile levels, the proposed methods will shrink the slopes toward constant and thus improve the estimation efficiency. We establish the oracle properties of the two proposed penalization methods. Through numerical investigations, we demonstrate that the proposed methods lead to estimations with competitive or higher efficiency than the standard quantile regression estimation in finite samples.

    abstract = {{As a result of the development of sophisticated techniques, such as multiple imputation, the interest in handling missing data in longitudinal studies has increased enormously in past years. Within the field of longitudinal data analysis, there is a current debate on whether it is necessary to use multiple imputations before performing a mixed-model analysis to analyze the longitudinal data. In the current study this necessity is evaluated. The results of mixed-model analyses with and without multiple imputation were compared with each other. Four data sets with missing values were created-one data set with missing completely at random, two data sets with missing at random, and one data set with missing not at random). In all data sets, the relationship between a continuous outcome variable and two different covariates were analyzed: a time-independent dichotomous covariate and a time-dependent continuous covariate. Although for all types of missing data, the results of the mixed-model analysis with or without multiple imputations were slightly different, they were not in favor of one of the two approaches. In addition, repeating the multiple imputations 100 times showed that the results of the mixed-model analysis with multiple imputation were quite unstable. It is not necessary to handle missing data using multiple imputations before performing a mixed-model analysis on longitudinal data.}},

    abstract = {{Although the frequentist paradigm has been the predominant approach to clinical trial design since the 1940s, it has several notable limitations. Advancements in computational algorithms and computer hardware have greatly enhanced the alternative Bayesian paradigm. Compared with its frequentist counterpart, the Bayesian framework has several unique advantages, and its incorporation into clinical trial design is occurring more frequently. Using an extensive literature review to assess how Bayesian methods are used in clinical trials, we find them most commonly used for dose finding, efficacy monitoring, toxicity monitoring, diagnosis/decision making, and studying pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics. The additional infrastructure required for implementing Bayesian methods in clinical trials may include specialized software programs to run the study design, simulation and analysis, and web-based applications, all of which are particularly useful for timely data entry and analysis. Trial success requires not only the development of proper tools but also timely and accurate execution of data entry, quality control, adaptive randomization, and Bayesian computation. The relative merit of the Bayesian and frequentist approaches continues to be the subject of debate in statistics. However, more evidence can be found showing the convergence of the two camps, at least at the practical level. Ultimately, better clinical trial methods lead to more efficient designs, lower sample sizes, more accurate conclusions, and better outcomes for patients enrolled in the trials. Bayesian methods offer attractive alternatives for better trials. More Bayesian trials should be designed and conducted to refine the approach and demonstrate their real benefit in action.}},

@article{oqu05exp,
    abstract = {{A coefficient of explained randomness, analogous to explained variation but for non-linear models, was presented by Kent. The construct hinges upon the notion of Kullback–Leibler information gain. Kent and O'Quigley developed these ideas, obtaining simple, multiple and partial coefficients for the situation of proportional hazards regression. Their approach was based upon the idea of transforming a general proportional hazards model to a specific one of Weibull form. Xu and O'Quigley developed a more direct approach, more in harmony with the semi-parametric nature of the proportional hazards model thereby simplifying inference and allowing, for instance, the use of time dependent covariates. A potential drawback to the coefficient of Xu and O'Quigley is its interpretation as explained randomness in the covariate given time. An investigator might feel that the interpretation of the Kent and O'Quigley coefficient, as a proportion of explained randomness of time given the covariate, is preferable. One purpose of this note is to indicate that, under an independent censoring assumption, the two population coefficients coincide. Thus the simpler inferential setting for Xu and O'Quigley can also be applied to the coefficient of Kent and O'Quigley. Our second purpose is to point out that a sample-based coefficient in common use in the SAS statistical package can be interpreted as an estimate of explained randomness when there is no censoring. When there is censoring the SAS coefficient would not seem satisfactory in that its population counterpart depends on an independent censoring mechanism. However there is a quick fix and we argue in favour of its use.}},

In recent years, physician performance scorecards have been used to provide feedback on individual measures; however, one key challenge is how to develop a composite quality index that combines multiple measures for overall physician performance evaluation. A controversy arises over establishing appropriate weights to combine indicators in multiple dimensions, and cannot be easily resolved. In this study, we proposed a generic unsupervised learning approach to develop a single composite index for physician performance assessment by using non-negative principal component analysis. We developed a new algorithm named iterative quadratic programming to solve the numerical issue in the non-negative principal component analysis approach. We conducted real case studies to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. We provided interpretations from both statistical and clinical perspectives to evaluate the developed composite ranking score in practice. In addition, we implemented the root cause assessment techniques to explain physician performance for improvement purposes.}},

In this article, we describe a random effect block bootstrap approach for clustered data that is simple to implement, free of both the distribution and the dependence assumptions of the parametric bootstrap, and is consistent when the mixed model assumptions are valid. Results based on Monte Carlo simulation show that the proposed method seems robust to failure of the dependence assumptions of the assumed mixed model. An application to a realistic environmental dataset indicates that the method produces sensible results.

Biostatistics plays an important role in health-related research, yet biostatistics resources are often fragmented, ad hoc, or oversubscribed within academic health centers (AHCs). Given the increasing complexity and quantity of health-related data, the emphasis on accelerating clinical and translational science, and the importance of conducting reproducible research, the need for the thoughtful development of biostatistics resources within AHCs is growing. In this article, the authors identify strategies for developing biostatistics resources in three areas: (1) recruiting and retaining biostatisticians, (2) efficiently using biostatistics resources, and (3) improving biostatistical contributions to science. AHCs should consider these three domains in building strong biostatistics resources, which they can leverage to support a broad spectrum of research. For each of the three domains, the authors describe the advantages and disadvantages of AHCs creating centralized biostatistics units rather than dispersing such resources across clinical departments or other research units. They also address the challenges that biostatisticians face in contributing to research without sacrificing their individual professional growth or the trajectory of their research teams. The authors ultimately recommend that AHCs create centralized biostatistics units because this approach offers distinct advantages both to investigators who collaborate with biostatisticians as well as to the biostatisticians themselves, and it is better suited to accomplish the research and education missions of AHCs.}},

Evaluation of various statistical techniques that have been developed for mixed data in simulated environments necessarily requires joint generation of multiple variables. Most massive public health data sets include different types of variables. For instance, in clustered or longitudinal designs, often multiple variables are measured or observed for each individual or at each occasion. This work is motivated by a need to jointly generate binary and possibly non-normal continuous variables. We illustrate the use of power polynomials to simulate multivariate mixed data on the basis of a real adolescent smoking study. We believe that our proposed technique for simulating such intensive data has the potential to be a handy methodological addition to public health researchers' toolkit.}},

    abstract = {{Simulations and Monte Carlo methods serve an important role in modern statistical research. They allow for an examination of the performance of statistical procedures in settings in which analytic and mathematical derivations may not be feasible. A key element in any statistical simulation is the existence of an appropriate data-generating process: one must be able to simulate data from a specified statistical model. We describe data-generating processes for the Cox proportional hazards model with time-varying covariates when event times follow an exponential, Weibull, or Gompertz distribution. We consider three types of time-varying covariates: first, a dichotomous time-varying covariate that can change at most once from untreated to treated (e.g., organ transplant); second, a continuous time-varying covariate such as cumulative exposure at a constant dose to radiation or to a pharmaceutical agent used for a chronic condition; third, a dichotomous time-varying covariate with a subject being able to move repeatedly between treatment states (e.g., current compliance or use of a medication). In each setting, we derive closed-form expressions that allow one to simulate survival times so that survival times are related to a vector of fixed or time-invariant covariates and to a single time-varying covariate. We illustrate the utility of our closed-form expressions for simulating event times by using Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the statistical power to detect as statistically significant the effect of different types of binary time-varying covariates. This is compared with the statistical power to detect as statistically significant a binary time-invariant covariate.}},

@article{yua12var,
    abstract = {{Extensive baseline covariate information is routinely collected on participants in randomized clinical trials, and it is well recognized that a proper covariate-adjusted analysis can improve the efficiency of inference on the treatment effect. However, such covariate adjustment has engendered considerable controversy, as post hoc selection of covariates may involve subjectivity and may lead to biased inference, whereas prior specification of the adjustment may exclude important variables from consideration. Accordingly, how to select covariates objectively to gain maximal efficiency is of broad interest. We propose and study the use of modern variable selection methods for this purpose in the context of a semiparametric framework, under which variable selection in modeling the relationship between outcome and covariates is separated from estimation of the treatment effect, circumventing the potential for selection bias associated with standard analysis of covariance methods. We demonstrate that such objective variable selection techniques combined with this framework can identify key variables and lead to unbiased and efficient inference on the treatment effect. A critical issue in finite samples is validity of estimators of uncertainty, such as standard errors and confidence intervals for the treatment effect. We propose an approach to estimation of sampling variation of estimated treatment effect and show its superior performance relative to that of existing methods.}},

    abstract = {Measures of predictive ability play an important role in quantifying the clinical significance of prognostic factors. Several measures have been proposed to evaluate the predictive ability of survival models in the last two decades, but no single measure is consistently used. The proposed measures can be classified into the following categories: explained variation, explained randomness, and predictive accuracy. The three categories are conceptually different and are based on different principles. Several new measures have been proposed since Schemper and Stare's study in 1996 on some of the existing measures. This paper is the first of two papers that study the proposed measures systematically by applying a set of criteria that a measure of predictive ability should possess in the context of survival analysis. The present paper focuses on the explained variation category, and part II studies the proposed measures in the other categories. Simulation studies are used to examine the performance of five explained variation measures with respect to these criteria, discussing their strengths and shortcomings. Our simulation studies show that the measures proposed by Kent and O'Quigley, $R^{2}\_{PM}$, and Royston and Sauerbrei, $R^{2}\_{D}$, appear to be the best overall at quantifying predictive ability. However, it should be noted that neither measure is perfect; $R^{2}\_{PM}$ is sensitive to outliers and $R^{2}\_{d}$ to (marked) non-normality of the distribution of the prognostic index. The results show that the other measures perform poorly, primarily because they are adversely affected by censoring.},

    abstract = {{Discrimination measures for continuous time-to-event outcomes have become an important tool in medical decision making. The idea behind discrimination measures is to evaluate the performance of a prediction model by measuring its ability to distinguish between observations having an event and those having no event. Researchers proposed a variety of approaches to estimate discrimination measures from a set of right-censored data. These approaches rely on different regularity assumptions that are needed to ensure consistency of the respective estimators. Typical examples of regularity assumptions include the proportional hazards assumption in Cox regression and the random censoring assumption. Because regularity assumptions are often violated in practice, conducting a sensitivity analysis of the estimators is of considerable interest. The aim of the paper is to analyze and to compare the most popular estimators of discrimination measures for event time outcomes. On the basis of the results of an extensive simulation study and the analysis of molecular data, we investigate the behavior of the estimators in situations where the underlying regularity assumptions do not hold. We show that violations of the regularity assumptions may induce a nonignorable bias and may therefore result in biased medical decision making.}},

    abstract = {{Diagnostic problems in medicine are sometimes polytomous, meaning that the outcome has more than two distinct categories. For example, ovarian tumors can be benign, borderline, primary invasive, or metastatic. Extending the main measure of binary discrimination, the c-statistic or area under the ROC curve, to nominal polytomous settings is not straightforward. This paper reviews existing measures and presents the polytomous discrimination index (PDI) as an alternative. The PDI assesses all sets of k cases consisting of one case from each outcome category. For each category i (i = 1, … ,k), it is assessed whether the risk of category i is highest for the case from category i. A score of 1∕k is given per category for which this holds, yielding a set score between 0 and 1 to indicate the level of discrimination. The PDI is the average set score and is interpreted as the probability to correctly identify a case from a randomly selected category within a set of k cases. This probability can be split up by outcome category, yielding k category-specific values that result in the PDI when averaged. We demonstrate the measures on two diagnostic problems (residual mass histology after chemotherapy for testicular cancer; diagnosis of ovarian tumors). We compare the behavior of the measures on theoretical data, showing that PDI is more strongly influenced by simultaneous discrimination between all categories than by partial discrimination between pairs of categories. In conclusion, the PDI is attractive because it better matches the requirements of a measure to summarize polytomous discrimination.}},

If multiple null hypotheses are tested simultaneously, the probability of rejecting erroneously at least one of them increases beyond the pre-specified significance level. Simultaneous inference procedures have to be used which adjust for multiplicity and thus control the overall type I error rate. In this paper we describe simultaneous inference procedures in general parametric models, where the experimental questions are specified through a linear combination of elemental model parameters. The framework described here is quite general and extends the canonical theory of multiple comparison procedures in ANOVA models to linear regression problems, generalized linear models, linear mixed effects models, the Cox model, robust linear models, etc. Several examples using a variety of different statistical models illustrate the breadth of the results. For the analyses we use the R add-on package multcomp, which provides a convenient interface to the general approach adopted here.}},

Advice is offered to members, often very experienced clinicians but inexperienced in pharmaceutical data review, as to how standard DMC data packages should be reviewed, which aspects of trial validity should be addressed, and how communication with the trial sponsor should be handled.

    abstract = {{Cardiovascular risk prediction functions offer an important diagnostic tool for clinicians and patients themselves. They are usually constructed with the use of parametric or semi-parametric survival regression models. It is essential to be able to evaluate the performance of these models, preferably with summaries that offer natural and intuitive interpretations. The concept of discrimination, popular in the logistic regression context, has been extended to survival analysis. However, the extension is not unique. In this paper, we define discrimination in survival analysis as the model's ability to separate those with longer event-free survival from those with shorter event-free survival within some time horizon of interest. This definition remains consistent with that used in logistic regression, in the sense that it assesses how well the model-based predictions match the observed data. Practical and conceptual examples and numerical simulations are employed to examine four $C$ statistics proposed in the literature to evaluate the performance of survival models. We observe that they differ in the numerical values and aspects of discrimination that they capture. We conclude that the index proposed by Harrell is the most appropriate to capture discrimination described by the above definition. We suggest researchers report which $C$ statistic they are using, provide a rationale for their selection, and be aware that comparing different indices across studies may not be meaningful.}},

ACL reconstruction is typically chosen by individuals to allow a return to their previous work and sports activities. Primary ACL reconstruction (ACLR) has in general been effective at restoring functional stability, but patients' modifiable predictors of both short- and long-term validated outcomes and OA are largely unknown. The Multicenter Orthopaedic Outcomes Network (MOON) consortium was established in 2002 to enroll and longitudinally follow a population cohort of ACL reconstructed patients. The objective was to establish patient-specific predictive models of clinically important outcomes. Over the past 10 years, the overarching aims of this NIAMS-funded prospective multicenter cohort of ACL reconstructions has been threefold: (1) to identify both short- and long-term prognosis and predictors of sports function, activity level, and general health through validated patient-reported outcomes, (2) to identify the symptoms and signs of OA, and (3) to quantify the incidence of ACL reconstruction graft and/or contralateral ACL failures and additional surgical procedures.

Data were used from a trial on the effects of Rosuvastatin on rate of change in carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT). The reference treatment effect was derived from a complete data set. Scenarios and proportions of missing values in CIMT measurements were applied and LME analyses were used before and after MI. The added value of MI, in terms of bias and precision, was assessed using the mean-squared error (MSE) of the treatment effects and coverage of the 95{\%} confidence interval. The reference treatment effect was -0.0177mm/y. The MSEs for LME analysis without and with MI were similar in scenarios with up to 40{\%} missing values. Coverage was large in all scenarios and was similar for LME with and without MI. Our study empirically shows that MI of missing end point data before LME analyses does not increase precision in the estimated rate of change in the end point. Hence, MI had no added value in this setting and standard LME modeling remains the method of choice.},

At the design stage, it is often assumed that the treatment hazard ratio (HR) is constant across the strata, and the data are commonly analyzed using the stratified Cox proportional hazards model. We caution that this ubiquitous approach is needlessly risky because departures from the assumption of the HR being the same for all the strata can result in a notably biased and/or less powerful analysis. An alternative approach is proposed in which first the [log] HR is estimated separately for each stratum using an unstratified Cox model, and then the stratum-specific estimates are combined for overall inference using either sample size or 'minimum risk' stratum weights. The advantages of the proposed two-step analysis versus the common one-step stratified Cox model analysis are illustrated using simulations that were conducted to support the design of a vaccine clinical trial.}},

The aging of populations carries over to clinical research and leads to an increasing representation of elderly and multimorbid individuals in study populations. Clinical research in these populations is complicated by the fact that individuals are likely to experience several potential disease endpoints that prevent some disease-specific endpoint of interest from occurrence. Large developments in competing risks methodology have been achieved over the last decades, but we assume that recognition of competing risks in the clinical community is still marginal. It is the aim of this article to address translational aspects of competing risks to the clinical community. We describe clinical populations where competing risks issues may arise. We then discuss the importance of agreement between the competing risks methodology and the study aim, in particular the distinction between etiologic and prognostic research questions. In a review of 50 clinical studies performed in individuals susceptible to competing risks published in high-impact clinical journals, we found competing risks issues in 70{\%} of all articles. Better recognition of issues related to competing risks and of statistical methods that deal with competing risks in accordance with the aim of the study is needed.},

However, existing methods for semiparametric longitudinal binary regression modeling (i) mainly concern mean structures with association parameters treated as nuisance; (ii) generally require a correct specification of the covariance structure for misspecified covariance structure may lead to inefficient mean parameter estimates; and (iii) usually run into computation and estimation problems when the time points are irregularly and possibly subject specific. In this article, we propose a semiparametric logistic regression model, which simultaneously takes into account both the mean and response-association structures (via conditional log-odds ratio) for multivariate longitudinal binary outcomes. Our main interest lies in efficient estimation of both the marginal and association parameters. The estimators of the parameters are obtained via the profile kernel approach. We evaluate the proposed methodology through simulation studies and apply it to a real dataset. Both theoretical and empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method yields highly efficient estimators and performs satisfactorily.}},

    abstract = {{Summary The standard estimator for the cause-specific cumulative incidence function in a competing risks setting with left truncated and/or right censored data can be written in two alternative forms. One is a weighted empirical cumulative distribution function and the other a product-limit estimator. This equivalence suggests an alternative view of the analysis of time-to-event data with left truncation and right censoring: individuals who are still at risk or experienced an earlier competing event receive weights from the censoring and truncation mechanisms. As a consequence, inference on the cumulative scale can be performed using weighted versions of standard procedures. This holds for estimation of the cause-specific cumulative incidence function as well as for estimation of the regression parameters in the Fine and Gray proportional subdistribution hazards model. We show that, with the appropriate filtration, a martingale property holds that allows deriving asymptotic results for the proportional subdistribution hazards model in the same way as for the standard Cox proportional hazards model. Estimation of the cause-specific cumulative incidence function and regression on the subdistribution hazard can be performed using standard software for survival analysis if the software allows for inclusion of time-dependent weights. We show the implementation in the R statistical package. The proportional subdistribution hazards model is used to investigate the effect of calendar period as a deterministic external time varying covariate, which can be seen as a special case of left truncation, on AIDS related and non-AIDS related cumulative mortality.}},

    abstract = {{Net reclassification and integrated discrimination improvements have been proposed as alternatives to the increase in the area under the curve for evaluating improvement in the performance of risk assessment algorithms introduced by the addition of new phenotypic or genetic markers. In this paper, we demonstrate that in the setting of linear discriminant analysis, under the assumptions of multivariate normality, all three measures can be presented as functions of the squared Mahalanobis distance. This relationship affords an interpretation of the magnitude of these measures in the familiar language of effect size for uncorrelated variables. Furthermore, it allows us to conclude that net reclassification improvement can be viewed as a universal measure of effect size. Our theoretical developments are illustrated with an example based on the Framingham Heart Study risk assessment model for high-risk men in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease}},

    abstract = {{When employing model selection methods with oracle properties such as the smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) and the Adaptive Lasso, it is typical to estimate the smoothing parameter by m-fold cross-validation, for example, m = 10. In problems where the true regression function is sparse and the signals large, such cross-validation typically works well. However, in regression modeling of genomic studies involving Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP), the true regression functions, while thought to be sparse, do not have large signals. We demonstrate empirically that in such problems, the number of selected variables using SCAD and the Adaptive Lasso, with 10-fold cross-validation, is a random variable that has considerable and surprising variation. Similar remarks apply to non-oracle methods such as the Lasso. Our study strongly questions the suitability of performing only a single run of m-fold cross-validation with any oracle method, and not just the SCAD and Adaptive Lasso.}},

To assess the adequacy of imputation models, we can compare completed data with their replicates simulated under the imputation model. We apply analyses of substantive interest to both datasets and use posterior predictive checks of the differences of these estimates to quantify the evidence of model inadequacy. We can further integrate out the imputed missing data and their replicates over the completed-data analyses to reduce variance in the comparison. In many cases, the checking procedure can be easily implemented using standard imputation software by treating re-imputations under the model as posterior predictive replicates. Thus, it can be applied for non-Bayesian imputation methods. We also sketch several strategies for applying the method in the context of practical imputation analyses. We illustrate the method using two real data applications and study its property using a simulation.}},

@article{gro12dea,
    abstract = {Although missing outcome data are an important problem in randomized trials and observational studies, methods to address this issue can be difficult to apply. Using simulated data, the authors compared 3 methods to handle missing outcome data: 1) complete case analysis; 2) single imputation; and 3) multiple imputation (all 3 with and without covariate adjustment). Simulated scenarios focused on continuous or dichotomous missing outcome data from randomized trials or observational studies. When outcomes were missing at random, single and multiple imputations yielded unbiased estimates after covariate adjustment. Estimates obtained by complete case analysis with covariate adjustment were unbiased as well, with coverage close to 95{\%}. When outcome data were missing not at random, all methods gave biased estimates, but handling missing outcome data by means of 1 of the 3 methods reduced bias compared with a complete case analysis without covariate adjustment. Complete case analysis with covariate adjustment and multiple imputation yield similar estimates in the event of missing outcome data, as long as the same predictors of missingness are included. Hence, complete case analysis with covariate adjustment can and should be used as the analysis of choice more often. Multiple imputation, in addition, can accommodate the missing-not-at-random scenario more flexibly, making it especially suited for sensitivity analyses.},

The simplicity achieved by creating $\geq 2$ artificial groups has a cost: Grouping may create rather than avoid problems. In particular, dichotomization leads to a considerable loss of power and incomplete correction for confounding factors. The use of data-derived ``optimal" cut-points can lead to serious bias and should at least be tested on independent observations to assess their validity. Both problems are illustrated by the way the results of a registry on unruptured intracranial aneurysms are commonly used. Extreme caution should restrict the application of such results to clinical decision-making. Categorization of continuous data, especially dichotomization, is unnecessary for statistical analysis. Continuous explanatory variables should be left alone in statistical models.}},

    abstract = {{The design of a comparative clinical trial involves a method of allocating treatments to patients. Usually, this assignment is performed to achieve several objectives: to minimize selection and accidental bias, to achieve balanced treatment assignment in order to maximize the power of the comparison, and most importantly, to obtain the basis for a valid statistical inference. In this paper, we are concerned exclusively with the last point. In our investigation, we will assume that measurements can be decomposed in a patient-specific effect, a treatment effect, and a measurement error. If the patient can be considered to be randomly drawn from a population, the randomization method does not affect the analysis. In fact, under this so-called population model, randomization would be unnecessary to obtain a valid inference. However, when individuals cannot be considered randomly selected, the patient effects may become fixed but unknown constants. In this case, randomization is necessary to obtain valid statistical analyses, and it cannot be precluded that the randomization method has an impact on the results. This paper elaborates that the impact can be substantial even for a two-sample comparison when a standard t-test is used for data analysis. We provide some theoretical results as well as simulations.}},

    abstract = {{The power of a chi-square test, and thus the required sample size, are a function of the noncentrality parameter that can be obtained as the limiting expectation of the test statistic under an alternative hypothesis specification. Herein, we apply this principle to derive simple expressions for two tests that are commonly applied to discrete ordinal data. The Wilcoxon rank sum test for the equality of distributions in two groups is algebraically equivalent to the Mann–Whitney test. The Kruskal–Wallis test applies to multiple groups. These tests are equivalent to a Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel mean score test using rank scores for a set of $C$-discrete categories. Although various authors have assessed the power function of the Wilcoxon and Mann–Whitney tests, herein it is shown that the power of these tests with discrete observations, that is, with tied ranks, is readily provided by the power function of the corresponding Cochran--Mantel--Haenszel mean scores test for two and $R > 2$ groups. These expressions yield results virtually identical to those derived previously for rank scores and also apply to other score functions. The Cochran–Armitage test for trend assesses whether there is an monotonically increasing or decreasing trend in the proportions with a positive outcome or response over the $C$-ordered categories of an ordinal independent variable, for example, dose. Herein, it is shown that the power of the test is a function of the slope of the response probabilities over the ordinal scores assigned to the groups that yields simple expressions for the power of the test.}},

    abstract = {{When a number of models are fit to the same data set, one method of choosing the `best' model is to select the model for which Akaike's information criterion (AIC) is lowest. AIC applies when maximum likelihood is used to estimate the unknown parameters in the model. The value of −2 log likelihood for each model fit is penalized by adding twice the number of estimated parameters. The number of estimated parameters includes both the linear parameters and parameters in the covariance structure. Another criterion for model selection is the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). BIC penalizes −2 log likelihood by adding the number of estimated parameters multiplied by the log of the sample size. For large sample sizes, BIC penalizes −2 log likelihood much more than AIC making it harder to enter new parameters into the model. An assumption in BIC is that the observations are independent. In mixed models, the observations are not independent. This paper develops a method for calculating the `effective sample size' for mixed models based on Fisher's information. The effective sample size replaces the sample size in BIC and can vary from the number of subjects to the number of observations. A number of error models are considered based on a general mixed model including unstructured, compound symmetry (random intercept), first-order autoregression with observational error and random intercept and slope.}},

    abstract = {{The phenomenon known as the winner's curse is a form of selection bias that affects estimates of genetic association. In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) the bias is exacerbated by the use of stringent selection thresholds and ranking over hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We develop an improved multi-locus bootstrap point estimate and confidence interval, which accounts for both ranking- and threshold-selection bias in the presence of genome-wide SNP linkage disequilibrium structure. The bootstrap method easily adapts to various study designs and alternative test statistics as well as complex SNP selection criteria. The latter is demonstrated by our application to the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium findings, in which the selection criterion was the minimum of the p-values for the additive and genotypic genetic effect models. In contrast, existing likelihood-based bias-reduced estimators account for the selection criterion applied to an SNP as if it were the only one tested, and so are more simple computationally, but do not address ranking across SNPs. Our simulation studies show that the bootstrap bias-reduced estimates are usually closer to the true genetic effect than the likelihood estimates and are less variable with a narrower confidence interval. Replication study sample size requirements computed from the bootstrap bias-reduced estimates are adequate 75–90 per cent of the time compared to 53-60 per cent of the time for the likelihood method. The bootstrap methods are implemented in a user-friendly package able to provide point and interval estimation for both binary and quantitative phenotypes in large-scale GWAS.}},

    abstract = {{OBJECTIVE: Researchers in Health Sciences and Medicine often use cohort designs to study treatment effects and changes of outcome variables over time period. The costs of these studies can be reduced by choosing an optimal number of repeated measurements over time and by selecting cohorts of subjects more efficiently with optimal design procedures. The objective of this study is to provide evidence on how to design large-scale cohort studies with budget constraints as efficiently as possible. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A linear cost function for repeated measurements is proposed, and this cost function is used in the optimization procedure. For a given budget/cost, different designs for linear mixed-effects models are compared by means of their efficiency. RESULTS: We found that adding more repeated measures is only beneficiary if the costs of selecting and measuring a new subject are much higher than the costs of obtaining an additional measurement for an already recruited subject. However, this gain in efficiency and power is not very large. CONCLUSION: Adding more cohorts or repeated measurements do not necessarily lead to a gain in efficiency of the estimated model parameters. A general guideline for the optimal choice of a cohort design in practice is required and we offer this guideline.}},

    abstract = {Objective\\Insecure hiding of the treatment allocation in randomized trials is associated with bias. It is less certain how much bias is associated with different methods of treatment allocation. \\Study Design and Setting\\ Meta-epidemiological study of 389 randomized trials from 19 systematic reviews and 65 meta-analyses with differing methods of treatment allocation. Pooled ratios of odds ratios (RORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (95{\%} CI) were calculated from trials with different methods of treatment allocation. An ROR less than one shows exaggeration of treatment effect. \\Results\\ There is no evidence that the use of sealed envelopes with enhancement was different from central randomization (ROR 1.02, 95{\%} CI: 0.85–1.23). Sealed envelopes without enhancement were associated with an exaggeration of the estimate of effect (ROR 0.87, 95{\%} CI: 0.76–1.00). Where allocation concealment for double-blind trials was unclear, the ROR is 0.86 (95{\%} CI: 0.78–0.96) and if not hidden, the ROR is 0.89 (95{\%} CI: 0.70–1.15). \\Conclusion\\ Sealed envelopes with some form of enhancement (opaque, sequentially numbered, and so forth) may give adequate concealment. Description of a study as "double blind" does not imply a lack of bias when concealment of allocation is unclear."},

    abstract = {{Analysis of a large longitudinal study of children motivated our work. The results illustrate how accurate inference for fixed effects in a general linear mixed model depends on the covariance model selected for the data. Simulation studies have revealed biased inference for the fixed effects with an underspecified covariance structure, at least in small samples. One underspecification common for longitudinal data assumes a simple random intercept and conditional independence of the within-subject errors (i.e., compound symmetry). We prove that the underspecification creates bias in both small and large samples, indicating that recruiting more participants will not alleviate inflation of the Type I error rate associated with fixed effect inference. Enumerations and simulations help quantify the bias and evaluate strategies for avoiding it. When practical, backwards selection of the covariance model, starting with an unstructured pattern, provides the best protection. Tutorial papers can guide the reader in minimizing the chances of falling into the often spurious software trap of nonconvergence. In some cases, the logic of the study design and the scientific context may support a structured pattern, such as an autoregressive structure. The sandwich estimator provides a valid alternative in sufficiently large samples. Authors reporting mixed-model analyses should note possible biases in fixed effects inference because of the following: (i) the covariance model selection process; (ii) the specific covariance model chosen; or (iii) the test approximation.}},

    abstract = {{The accuracy of gene localization, the reliability of locus-specific effect estimates, and the ability to replicate initial claims of linkage and/or association have emerged as major methodological concerns in genomewide studies of complex diseases and quantitative traits. To address the issue of multiple comparisons inherent in genomewide studies, the use of stringent criteria for assessing statistical significance has been generally acknowledged as a strategy to control type I error. However, the application of genomewide significance criteria does not take account of the selection bias introduced into parameter estimates, e.g., estimates of locus-specific effect size of disease/trait loci. Some have argued that reliable locus-specific parameter estimates can only be obtained in an independent sample. In this report, we examine statistical resampling techniques, including cross-validation and the bootstrap, applied to the initial sample to improve the estimation of locus-specific effects. We compare them with the na\"{i}ve method in which all data are used for both hypothesis testing and parameter estimation, as well as with the split-sample approach in which part of the data are reserved for estimation. Upward bias of the na\"{i}ve estimator and inadequacy of the split-sample approach are derived analytically under a simple quantitative trait model. Simulation studies of the resampling methods are performed for both the simple model and a more realistic genomewide linkage analysis. Our results suggest that cross-validation and bootstrap methods can substantially reduce the estimation bias, especially when the effect size is small or there is no genetic effect.}},

@article{giu11spe,
    abstract = {Sightability models are binary logistic-regression models used to estimate and adjust for visibility bias in wildlife-population surveys. Like many models in wildlife and ecology, sightability models are typically developed from small observational datasets with many candidate predictors. Aggressive model-selection methods are often employed to choose a best model for prediction and effect estimation, despite evidence that such methods can lead to overfitting (i.e., selected models may describe random error or noise rather than true predictor–response curves) and poor predictive ability. We used moose (Alces alces) sightability data from northeastern Minnesota (2005–2007) as a case study to illustrate an alternative approach, which we refer to as degrees-of-freedom (df) spending: sample-size guidelines are used to determine an acceptable level of model complexity and then a pre-specified model is fit to the data and used for inference. For comparison, we also constructed sightability models using Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) step-down procedures and model averaging (based on a small set of models developed using df-spending guidelines). We used bootstrap procedures to mimic the process of model fitting and prediction, and to compute an index of overfitting, expected predictive accuracy, and model-selection uncertainty. The index of overfitting increased 13{\%} when the number of candidate predictors was increased from three to eight and a best model was selected using step-down procedures. Likewise, model-selection uncertainty increased when the number of candidate predictors increased. Model averaging (based on R = 30 models with 1–3 predictors) effectively shrunk regression coefficients toward zero and produced similar estimates of precision to our 3-df pre-specified model. As such, model averaging may help to guard against overfitting when too many predictors are considered (relative to available sample size). The set of candidate models will influence the extent to which coefficients are shrunk toward zero, which has implications for how one might apply model averaging to problems traditionally approached using variable-selection methods. We often recommend the df-spending approach in our consulting work because it is easy to implement and it naturally forces investigators to think carefully about their models and predictors. Nonetheless, similar concepts should apply whether one is fitting 1 model or using multi-model inference. For example, model-building decisions should consider the effective sample size, and potential predictors should be screened (without looking at their relationship to the response) for missing data, narrow distributions, collinearity, potentially overly influential observations, and measurement errors (e.g., via logical error checks).},

    abstract = {{It has become common to adopt a hierarchical model structure when comparing the performance of multiple health-care providers. This structure allows some variation in such measures, beyond that explained by sampling variation, to be  ” normal,” in recognition of the fact that risk-adjustment is never perfect. The shrinkage estimates arising from such a model structure also have appealing properties. It is not immediately clear, however, how  ” unusual” providers, that is, any with particularly high or low rates, can be identified based on such a model. Given that some variation in underlying rates is assumed to be the norm, we argue that it is not generally appropriate to identify a provider as interesting based only on evidence of it lying above or below the population mean. We note with concern, however, that this practice is not uncommon. We examine in detail three possible strategies for identifying unusual providers, carefully distinguishing between statistical  ” outliers” and  ” extremes.” A two-level normal model is used for mathematical simplicity, but we note that much of the discussion also applies to alternative data structures. Further, we emphasize throughout that each approach can be viewed as resulting from a Bayesian or a classical perspective. Three worked examples provide additional insight.}},

    abstract = {{Monitoring binary outcomes when evaluating health care performance has recently become common. Classical statistical methodologies such as cumulative sum (CUSUM) charts have been refined and used for this purpose. For instance, the risk-adjusted CUSUM chart (RA-CUSUM) for monitoring binary outcomes was proposed for monitoring 30-day mortality following cardiac surgery. The RA-CUSUM inherits optimality properties of the original CUSUM charts in the sense of signaling early when there is change. However, although the RA-CUSUM is a powerful monitoring tool, it will always eventually signal a change with probability 1 even when there is no real change. In other words, the probability of a type I error for the RA-CUSUM is 1. It also turns out that, because of the skewed distribution of the run lengths of the RA-CUSUM, the median is often well below the mean, and as a consequence more than half of all its false alarms occur before the designed average run length. In addition, when the change to be detected occurs at a later time in the series of observations being monitored, the rate of false alarms increases, and the RA-CUSUM may not be appropriate. Therefore, if the price of false alarms is high, it is preferable to use methods that control the rate of false alarms. In this paper, we propose alternative sequential curtailed and risk-adjusted charts that control the type I error rate in the context of monitoring 30-day mortality following cardiac surgery. We explore the merits of each of these methodologies in terms of average run lengths as well as in terms of type I error probabilities, and we compare them to the RA-CUSUM chart. We illustrate the methodologies by using data on monitoring performance of seven surgeons from a medical center.}},

Statistical thinking uses probabilistic descriptions of variability in (1) inductive reasoning and (2) analysis of procedures for data collection, prediction, and scientific inference. ... The essential component that characterizes the discipline is the introduction of probability to describe variation in order to provide a good solution to a problem involving the reduction of data for a specific purpose. ... (we) elaborate our definition of statistical thinking by stating that it involves two principles: 1. Statistical models of regularity and variability in data may be used to express knowledge and uncertainty about a signal in the presence of noise, via inductive reasoning. 2.

    abstract = {Atrial fibrillation affects more than 2 million people in the United States and accounts for nearly 1{\%} of emergency department (ED) visits. Physicians have little information to guide risk stratification of patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation and admit more than 65{\%}. Our aim is to assess whether data available in the ED management of symptomatic atrial fibrillation can estimate a patient's risk of experiencing a 30-day adverse event.We systematically reviewed the electronic medical records of all ED patients presenting with symptomatic atrial fibrillation between August 2005 and July 2008. Predefined adverse outcomes included 30-day ED return visit, unscheduled hospitalization, cardiovascular complication, or death. We performed multivariable logistic regression to identify predictors of 30-day adverse events. The model was validated with 300 bootstrap replications.During the 3-year study period, 914 patients accounted for 1,228 ED visits. Eighty patients were excluded for non-atrial-fibrillation-related complaints and 2 patients had no follow-up recorded. Of 832 eligible patients, 216 (25.9{\%}) experienced at least 1 of the 30-day adverse events. Increasing age (odds ratio [OR] 1.20 per decade; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 1.36 per decade), complaint of dyspnea (OR 1.57; 95{\%} CI 1.12 to 2.20), smokers (OR 2.35; 95{\%} CI 1.47 to 3.76), inadequate ventricular rate control (OR 1.58; 95{\%} CI 1.13 to 2.21), and patients receiving $\beta$-blockers (OR 1.44; 95{\%} CI 1.02 to 2.04) were independently associated with higher risk for adverse events. C-index was 0.67.In ED patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation, increased age, inadequate ED ventricular rate control, dyspnea, smoking, and β-blocker treatment were associated with an increased risk of a 30-day adverse event.},

@article{hip07reg,
    abstract = {{When fitting a generalized linear model--such as linear regression, logistic regression, or hierarchical linear modeling--analysts often wonder how to handle missing values of the dependent variable Y. If missing values have been filled in using multiple imputation, the usual advice is to use the imputed Y values in analysis. We show, however, that using imputed Ys can add needless noise to the estimates. Better estimates can usually be obtained using a modified strategy that we call multiple imputation, then deletion (MID). Under MID, all cases are used for imputation, but following imputation cases with imputed Y values are excluded from the analysis. When there is something wrong with the imputed Y values, MID protects the estimates from the problematic imputations. And when the imputed Y values are acceptable, MID usually offers somewhat more efficient estimates than an ordinary MI strategy. From Peter Lachenbruch: Going back to Bruce Weaver's comment, I've finished reading van Hippel's paper and the argument is 1. Use all variables to impute all others - this will include the y variable - i.e. a y that is present carries information on the missing x values. 2. After the imputation step, remove all cases in which the y value is missing. The reason for this is that these cases carry no information about the regression of y on the x values. The math for this is outlined in van Hippel's paper. The y values do carry information about the x values (whether missing or not) and so can be used for the imputation. Once imputation is complete, the imputed y values carry no information for the regression - and add nothing further. Thus, by deleting these observations, we obtain a slightly better prediction. In his paper, the simulations are based on normal distributions, and the improvement is small. Nothing was said about imputation and prediction for non-normal (e.g., binary or poisson) cases. Still an open question. 3. For the query posted by Irene Zeng: Missing at baseline is always a pain in the neck, but if you have plenty of other times, you can impute the baseline and then use your Kaplan-Meier estimate (or a proportional hazards model). Using means is almost always a bad idea, and even worse is last observation carried forward (or first observation carried backward).}},

The stated goal of this operation is to provide unitless covariates to compare like with like, especially when penalized likelihood or prior distributions are used. We contend that this vision is too simplistic. Instead, we propose to take into account a more essential component of the structure of the regression matrix by rescaling the covariates based on the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ of the maximum-likelihood estimator. We illustrate the differences between the standard $\rho$ and proposed $\Sigma$-rescalings with various estimators and data sets.}},

Health care, because of its desire to be `scientific,' has not only been stricken by the curse of Kelvin, but has positively embraced it; this despite the fact that many prominent scientists (including some of Kelvin's contemporaries, eg, Darwin or Virchow) succeeded while completely ignoring his advice. Thus, we see a proliferation of scales and measurement instruments aimed at quantifying the hitherto unquantifiable". A.R.

An initiative to advance our knowledge about the effectiveness of clinical strategies can hasten the day when personalized medicine transforms health care.... large observational databases and pooled trial results can be used to learn more about the subgroups of patients who benefit from therapy. A recent study showed that mortality was similar overall for patients with coronary disease whether treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary-artery bypass surgery. However, the results varied strikingly with age: mortality was much lower with surgery among patients 65 years of age or older and lower with PCI among those 55 years of age or younger. Such information is important not only for patients with varying risk characteristics and coexisting conditions but for women, members of minority groups, and others who have historically been underrepresented in clinical trials. Current CER efforts aim to ensure that much more useful data will be collected and that better methods will be developed for understanding differences in effectiveness among different patient groups. ... The greatest obstacle to the adoption of personalized approaches such as genomic testing, however, is the lack of adequately designed studies assessing their clinical utility. Often there is little consensus about the best way to design and implement such studies. We may know very little about how a test might improve health in typical clinical settings. These are precisely the kinds of issues that CER is designed to address. ... Genomic medicine, however, has had little impact to date in most areas of care -- a fact that some critics blame on payers, claiming that they impose unrealistically high evidence barriers before agreeing to pay for genomic tests. But payers have often championed personalized approaches -- for example, by reimbursing for KRAS testing before the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has fully embraced it. The real bottleneck is often the science itself: progress in identifying clinically important genetic variants has been slow, since seldom does the presence of a common variant greatly increase the relative risk of a serious disease or of severe harm from treatment. Moreover, only some genomic tests provide clinically important information. For example, although the FDA endorsed the use of genomic tests to identify persons with warfarin sensitivity, comparative trials showed that the tests added little value over careful monitoring of the international normalized ratio. Chromosomal mutation 9p21.3 is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease in women, but a recent study showed that knowledge of its presence adds no additional predictive power to the standard information on risk.

    abstract = {SNPs discovered by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) account for only a small fraction of the genetic variation of complex traits in human populations. Where is the remaining heritability? We estimated the proportion of variance for human height explained by 294,831 SNPs genotyped on 3,925 unrelated individuals using a linear model analysis, and validated the estimation method with simulations based on the observed genotype data. We show that 45{\%} of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests. We provide evidence that the remaining heritability is due to incomplete linkage disequilibrium between causal variants and genotyped SNPs, exacerbated by causal variants having lower minor allele frequency than the SNPs explored to date.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND:Many randomized trials involve measuring a continuous outcome - such as pain, body weight or blood pressure - at baseline and after treatment. In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between baseline and post-treatment; percentage change between baseline and post-treatment and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between baseline and post-treatment scores.RESULTS:ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from baseline has acceptable power when correlation between baseline and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from baseline has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from baseline will also fail to protect from bias in the case of baseline imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data.CONCLUSIONS:Percentage change from baseline should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean baseline scores.}},

    abstract = {{The use of the Gibbs sampler with fully conditionally specified models, where the distribution of each variable given the other variables is the starting point, has become a popular method to create imputations in incomplete multivariate data. The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.}},

To get around copyright protection, Ronald Fisher restructered the tables to present critical values for $t$ for $\alpha=.01, .02, .05, .1, .2, .3, ... .9$. This has led to the use of cutoffs for $P$-values to determine what Fisher called "significance", which has led to widespread problems in science and especially to publication bias.

ROC curves lack or obscure several quantities that are necessary for evaluating the operational effectiveness of diagnostic tests. ... ROC curves were first used to check how radio \emph{receivers} (like radar receivers) operated over a range of frequencies. ... This is not how most ROC curves are used now, particularly in medicine. The receiver of a diagnostic measurement ... wants to make a decision based on some $x\_{c}$, and is not especially interested in how well he would have done had he used some different cutoff."; in the discussion David Hand states "when integrating to yield the overall AUC measure, it is necessary to decide what weight to give each value in the integration. The AUC implicitly does this using a weighting derived empirically from the data. This is nonsensical. The relative importance of misclassifying a case as a noncase, compared to the reverse, cannot come from the data itself. It must come externally, from considerations of the severity one attaches to the different kinds of misclassifications."; see Lin, Kvam, Lu Stat in Med 28:798-813;2009},

@article{gra07how,
    abstract = {{Multiple imputation (MI) and full information maximum likelihood (FIML) are the two most common approaches to missing data analysis. In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information (gamma) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which gamma and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on gamma, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.}},

Our general theoretical framework includes ordinary least squares, generalized linear models, quantile regression, and many others as special cases. Specifically, LSA can transfer many different types of LASSO objective functions into their asymptotically equivalent least squares problems. Thereafter, the standard asymptotic theory can be established and the LARS algorithm can be applied. In particular, if the adaptive LASSO penalty and a Bayes information criterion–type tuning parameter selector are used, the resulting LSA estimator can be as efficient as the oracle. Extensive numerical studies confirm our theory.}},

Pearson modification of Pearson chi-square test, differing from the original by a factor of (N-1)/N;Cochran noted that the number 5 in "expected frequency less than 5" was arbitrary;findings of published studies may be summarized as follows, for comparative trials:"1. Yate's chi-squared test has type I error rates less than the nominal, often less than half the nominal; 2. The Fisher-Irwin test has type I error rates less than the nominal; 3. K Pearson's version of the chi-squared test has type I error rates closer to the nominal than Yate's chi-squared test and the Fisher-Irwin test, but in some situations gives type I errors appreciably larger than the nominal value; 4. The 'N-1' chi-squared test, behaves like K. Pearson's 'N' version, but the tendency for higher than nominal values is reduced; 5. The two-sided Fisher-Irwin test using Irwin's rule is less conservative than the method doubling the one-sided probability; 6. The mid-P Fisher-Irwin test by doubling the one-sided probability performs better than standard versions of the Fisher-Irwin test, and the mid-P method by Irwin's rule performs better still in having actual type I errors closer to nominal levels."; strong support for the 'N-1' test provided expected frequencies exceed 1;flaw in Fisher test which was based on Fisher's premise that marginal totals carry no useful information;demonstration of their useful information in very small sample sizes;Yate's continuity adjustment of N/2 is a large over correction and is inappropriate;counter arguments exist to the use of randomization tests in randomized trials;calculations of worst cases;overall recommendation: use the 'N-1' chi-square test when all expected frequencies are at least 1, otherwise use the Fisher-Irwin test using Irwin's rule for two-sided tests, taking tables from either tail as likely, or less, as that observed; see letter to the editor by Antonio Andres and author's reply in 27:1791-1796; 2008.},

Most of the 866 patients enrolled in our multicenter study underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring and determination of the resting radionuclide ventricular ejection fraction before discharge. Univariate analyses showed a progressive increase in cardiac mortality during one year as the ejection fraction fell below 0.40 and as the number of ventricular ectopic depolarizations exceeded one per hour. Only four risk factors among eight prespecified variables were independent predictors of mortality: an ejection fraction below 0.40, ventricular ectopy of 10 or more depolarizations per hour, advanced New York Heart Association functional class before infarction, and rales heard in the upper two thirds of the lung fields while the patient was in the coronary-care unit. Various combinations of these four factors identified five risk subgroups with two-year mortality rates ranging from 3 per cent (no factors) to 60 per cent (all four factors).}},

    abstract = {One motivation for estimating the standard error, SEMw, of a weighted mean concentration, Mw, of an ion in precipitation is to use it to compute a confidence interval for Mw. Typically this is done by multiplying the standard error by a factor that depends on the degree of confidence one wishes to express, on the assumption that the weighted mean has a normal distribution. This paper compares confidence intervals of Mw concentrations of ions in precipitation, as computed using the assumption of a normal distribution, with those estimated from distributions produced by bootstrapping. The hypothesis that Mw was normally distributed was rejected about half the time (at the 5{\%} significance level) in tests involving nine major ions measured at ten diverse sites in the National Atmospheric Deposition Program/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN). Most of these rejections occurred at sites with fewer than 100 samples, in agreement with previous results. Nevertheless, the hypothesis was often rejected at sites with more than 100 samples as well. The maximum error (relative to Mw) in the 95{\%} confidence limits made by assuming a normal distribution of the Mw at the ten sites examined was about 27{\%}. Most such errors were less than 10{\%}, and errors were smaller at sampling sites with > 100 samples than at those with < 100 samples.},

This paper compares three methods from the literature with a standard based on bootstrapping. Comparative calculations were carried out for nine major ions measured at 222 sampling sites in the National Atmospheric Deposition/National Trends Network (NADP/NTN). The ratio variance approximation of Cochran (1977) gave results that were not statistically different from those of bootstrapping, and is suggested as the method of choice for routine computing of the standard error of the weighted mean. The bootstrap method has advantages of its own, including the fact that it is nonparametric, but requires additional effort and computation time.}},

The set of `other possible results' depends on the experimental design. ... Everything that is known is taken as given and all probabilities are calculated conditionally on known values. ... in contrast to the frequentist approach, only the probabilities of the observed results matter. ... The continuous learning that is possible in the Bayesian approach enables investigators to modify trials in midcourse. ... it is possible to learn from small samples, depending on the results, ... it is possible to adapt to what is learned to enable better treatment of patients. ... subjectivity in prior distributions is explicit and open to examination (and critique) by all. ...

    abstract = {The aim of this study was to use Monte Carlo simulations to compare logistic regression with propensity scores in terms of bias, precision, empirical coverage probability, empirical power, and robustness when the number of events is low relative to the number of confounders. The authors simulated a cohort study and performed 252,480 trials. In the logistic regression, the bias decreased as the number of events per confounder increased. In the propensity score, the bias decreased as the strength of the association of the exposure with the outcome increased. Propensity scores produced estimates that were less biased, more robust, and more precise than the logistic regression estimates when there were seven or fewer events per confounder. The logistic regression empirical coverage probability increased as the number of events per confounder increased. The propensity score empirical coverage probability decreased after eight or more events per confounder. Overall, the propensity score exhibited more empirical power than logistic regression. Propensity scores are a good alternative to control for imbalances when there are seven or fewer events per confounder; however, empirical power could range from 35{\%} to 60{\%}. Logistic regression is the technique of choice when there are at least eight events per confounder.},

Sotiriou and colleagues probably used the same genes in all cross-validation sets, although this point is unclear. van't Veer and colleagues did both complete and incomplete cross-validations, focusing primarily on the results of the incomplete cross-validation (for the same genes each time), but the error rate was higher ... in the complete cross-validation. Three other groups ... also selected among several gene models the ones with best performance in cross-validation. ... However the best performance was seen in four small datasets ... the odds of reaching a formally significant association increased 3.5 times ... per doubling of sample size and 9.7 times ... per ten-fold increase in the number of probes. ... A study on lung adenocarcinoma found that unsupervised DNA microarray analysis predicted death with a sensitivity of 38{\%} and a specificity of 81{\%}. Cross-validation of supervised modelling gave 71{\%} sensitivity and 66{\%} specificity.

We assessed 84 DNA microarray studies addressing important clinical issues on cancer outcomes and correlates. The predictive performance of this new technique was variable, and in many cases molecular classifications were not subjected to appropriate validation. Validation in independent datasets has been rare. Furthermore, without full adjustment for previously known predictors of cancer outcomes, appraisal of the contribution of DNA microarray data towards individualising cancer management is difficult. ... incomplete cross-validation can lead to inflated estimates of accuracy. ... Reporting of only the best results spuriously inflates accuracy. ... Phase III studies have been rare in prognostic research in general. ...

Many students are confused by the central limit theorem, thinking it applies to both type I and II errors when it only applies to type I. There is another hazard to multi-step approaches, related to not preserving type I error.

    annote = {"Theoretical and empirical results indicate that the popular version of stratification via estimated propensity scores based on within-stratum sample mean differences and a fixed number of strata can lead to biased inference due to residual confounding, and the effect of this bias becomes more serious with increasing sample size. Using more strata can increase the sample size at which the trade-off of bias and variability involved in efficiency takes place, but stratifying on quintiles seems to be the most popular approach in practice, even for substantial sample sizes. Thus, as the trade-off point will be unknown for any specific problem, this approach should be used with caution. An interesting avenue for future research would be to establish guidelines for choosing the number of strata based on theoretical analysis of the rate at which the number of strata should increase with sample size to eliminate bias. A modification of stratification based instead on within-stratum regression estimates of treatment effect can eliminate this bias and achieve dramatic improvements in efficiency, but correct specification of the regression model is essential; otherwise, bias and degradation of performance can result. In this regard, this approach is similar to estimating causal effects via direct regression modelling but is less sensitive to mismodelling. Methods based on weighting are consistent and offer approximately unbiased inference for practical sample sizes. The semiparametric efficient estimator identified by the theory of Robins et al. [13], which incorporates regression modelling as a way to gain efficiency, also yields high precision. Although stratification based on regression and direct modelling can outperform this approach under some conditions, this estimator enjoys the unique 'double robustness' property in that it continues to lead to unbiased estimation of the average causal effect even if the regression models involved do not coincide with the true relationship, affording the analyst broad protection against misspecification not available with these other approaches. The results presented here support routine use of this estimator in practice."; nice derivations of inner workings of propensity score},

You are confronted with a question: Is the percentage of African countries in the United Nations greater or less than 65? Not a matter you have thought much about, but nonetheless, you are fairly sure that the percentage is less than 65. What, you are asked, is the \emph{exact} percentage of African countries in the United Nations? After some thought, you respond with an estimate of 45 percent. A research records your response, thanks you for your time, and off you go. Now you are another person, a person who has not yet answered questions about the United Nations, a person for whom the wheel of fortune will land on 10 rather than 65. After the wheel has stopped moving, the researcher asks: Is the percentage of African countries in the United Nations great or less than 10? More you say -- certainly it must be more. What is the \emph{exact} percentage of African countries in the United Nations? After some thought, you respond with an estimate of 25 percent. In fact, just a procedure, yielding identical results, was conducted by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman (1974). Subjects who were randomly assigned to an experimental condition in which the needle landed on 65 subsequently gave a median estimate of 45 percent, and subjects for whom the needle landed on 10 gave a median estimate of 25 percent. Tversky and Kahneman explained this phenomenon in terms of 'anchoring and adjustment' -- that is, the insufficient adjustment up or down from an original starting value, or 'anchor'. ... Surprisingly, the effects of anchoring do not disappear with monetary incentives for accuracy (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974; Wright and Anderson, 1989) or with outrageously extreme anchors (Quattrone et al., 1984). In one experiment, Quattrone and his associates (1984) solicited exact numerical estimates after first asking whether the number of Beatles records that had made the top 10 fell above or below 100,025 albums, whether the average price of a college textbook was more or less than $7128.53, or whether the average temperature in San Francisco was greater or less than 558$^{\deg}$. Quattrone's research team found that absurdly high anchor values worked just as well as more plausible anchor values. From this result, they concluded that anchoring is a robust phenomenon in which the size of the effect grows with the discrepancy between the anchor and the 'preanchor estimate' ... until the effect reaches an asymptotic level. If true, these findings suggest that negotiators, advertisers, politicians, and other persuasion specialists will generally be most succesful by staking out extreme initial positions."},

They identified 19 different cutpoints used in the literature; some of them were solely used because they emerged as the `optimal' cutpoint in a specific data set. In a meta-analysis on the relationship between cathepsin-D content and disease-free survival in node-negative breast cancer patients, 12 studies were in included with 12 different cutpoints ...

This does not seem to follow logically although it has certainly been the tradition. If a drug changes heart rate and this is prognostic of bad outcomes for the patient, and if correcting for the change in heart rate removes a bad prognostic effect of QT changes, can it not be a mistake to correct for heart rate changes? A good deal of the paper rests on the between-patient variance being greater than zero. The confidence interval for d11 is [.0018,.0190] which goes fairly close to zero. Isn't there a boundary problem at zero with MLE or REML estimates of variances? Has the confidence coverage of such confidence intervals (both tails being 0.025) been verified by simulation? Your model in section 4.2 is on the QT scale but your other models were on the log QT scale. How do you know which scale is appropriate for section 4.2? You have a lot of heart cycles per subject available for analysis. I am unclear how many were used per subject when fitting equation (3). It would make sense to use hundreds of cycles per subject when modeling within-patient heart rate dependency on QT intervals.},

In particular, does the number and types of errors identified with this approach justify the extra effort involved? We report the results of a study carried out to address this question. Our main outcome measure was the frequency and types of errors involved in the entry of data for the CHART (continuous, hyperfractionated, accelerated radiotherapy) trials. Data were reentered for a sample of 44 patients by a data manager other than the one making the initial entry. The second entry was then compared with the first entry. The error rate for the two entries combined was 14 per 10,000 data items (fields) (95{\%} confidence interval 10, 19). The error rate for the initial entry alone was 15 per 10,000 fields (95{\%} confidence interval 9.5, 22), and the vital/important error rate (defined as any error on a principal outcome measure or a major error on any other endpoint or variable) was 2.5 per 10,000 fields (95{\%} confidence interval 0.68, 6.4). On this evidence double data entry is not performed for the CHART trials.},

The book also deals quite a bit with why people believe in ineffective remedies for illness, and why people are impressed with coincidences. A theme that runs through the book is that people are good with numerators but not with denominators. The book has widespread applicability to how we interpret information and will make every reader a better decision maker.},

The proposed methods should be useful for both identifying and interpreting group differences.}},

In contrast, population-averaged estimates of treatment effect compare outcomes in groups of patients. The groups being compared are determined by whatever covariates are included in the model.

I do not believe that anything that is good science can be bad statistics, and conclude my remarks with the hope that there are no statisticians so inflexible as to decline to analyze an honest body of scientific data simply because it fails to conform to some favored theoretical scheme.

P. 421: It is `well known' to be `logically unsound and practically misleading' (Zhang, 1992) to make inferences as if a model is known to be true when it has, in fact, been selected from the {\em same} data to be used for estimation purposes. However, although statisticians may admit this privately (Breiman (1992) calls it a `quiet scandal'), they (we) continue to ignore the difficulties because it is not clear what else could or should be done. P. 421: Estimation errors for regression coefficients are usually smaller than errors from failing to take into account model specification. P. 422: Statisticians must stop pretending that model uncertainty does not exist and begin to find ways of coping with it. P. 426: It is indeed strange that we often admit model uncertainty by searching for a best model but then ignore this uncertainty by making inferences and predictions as if certain that the best fitting model is actually true. P. 427: The analyst needs to assess the model selection {\em process} and not just the best fitting model. P. 432: The use of subset selection methods is well known to introduce alarming biases. P. 433: ... the AIC can be highly biased in data-driven model selection situations. P. 434: Prediction intervals will generally be too narrow. In the discussion, Jamal R. M. Ameen states that a model should be (a) satisfactory in performance relative to the stated objective, (b) logically sound, (c) representative, (d) questionable and subject to on-line interrogation, (e) able to accommodate external or expert information and (f) able to convey information.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The TNM staging system originated as a response to the need for an accurate, consistent, universal cancer outcome prediction system. Since the TNM staging system was introduced in the 1950s, new prognostic factors have been identified and new methods for integrating prognostic factors have been developed. This study compares the prediction accuracy of the TNM staging system with that of artificial neural network statistical models. METHODS: For 5-year survival of patients with breast or colorectal carcinoma, the authors compared the TNM staging system's predictive accuracy with that of artificial neural networks (ANN). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, as applied to an independent validation data set, was the measure of accuracy. RESULTS: For the American College of Surgeons' Patient Care Evaluation (PCE) data set, using only the TNM variables (tumor size, number of positive regional lymph nodes, and distant metastasis), the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with breast carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.720; ANN, 0.770; P < 0.001). For the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epi, and End Results breast carcinoma data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of 10-year survival were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.692; ANN, 0.730; P < 0.01). For the PCE colorectal data set, using only the TNM variables, the artificial neural network's predictions of the 5-year survival of patients with colorectal carcinoma were significantly more accurate than those of the TNM staging system (TNM, 0.737; ANN, 0.815; P < 0.001). Adding commonly collected demographic and anatomic variables to the TNM variables further increased the accuracy of the artificial neural network's predictions of breast carcinoma survival (0.784) and colorectal carcinoma survival (0.869). CONCLUSIONS: Artificial neural networks are significantly more accurate than the TNM staging system when both use the TNM prognostic factors alone. New prognostic factors can be added to artificial neural networks to increase prognostic accuracy further. These results are robust across different data sets and cancer sites.}},
