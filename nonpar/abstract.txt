Introduction to Nonparametric Statistical Tests

This workshop will cover some guidelines on when to use nonparametric
statistical tests, and will describe some of the most commonly used
tests.  Descriptives statistics that go along with these tests will be
briefly covered, and the proportional odds ordinal regression model
will be briefly described as a generalization of common nonparametric
tests.
