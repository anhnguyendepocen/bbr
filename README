To run pdflatex on bbr.tex you'll need several things including various images that are symbolically linked to subdirectories here, a bibliographic database, and LaTeX style files.  The style files are available at https://github.com/harrelfe/rlatex .  It is recommended that you use the "easy install" method documented there.

The symbolic links are gradually being moved to the slinks directory, including the bibliographic database.

Email f.harrell@vanderbilt.edu to get a zip file containing all the real files that can replace the symbolic links in slinks.
